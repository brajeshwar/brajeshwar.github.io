The domain `brajeshwar.com` was registered on `Jun 11, 2001`.

I booked the domain on a dare. At work, I once met an expert programmer, who suggested I should write down all the Flash[^Flash] tips, tricks, and things I was doing. That's how it all started. My website started as a Flash-Website.

I moved on to Blogspot, later known as Blogger[^Blogger], then to MovableType[^MovableType] in 2002, and later to WordPress[^WordPress] by 2003-2004, ever since its early beta. I stayed with WordPress for a very long time - about 18 years.

Initially, the site was hosted on few local shared servers. The site really did grew in popularity after Macromedia's recognition. Later, it was cared for by [Media Temple](https://mediatemple.net), [Medium Cube](https://mediumcube.com) (special thanks to [Tamouh Hakmi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamouh/)), [Pagely](https://pagely.com), and [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com) (grandfathered me in a free tier forever).

## Writers

Quite a few writers contributed to brajeshwar.com. Unfortunately, the website is now super simplified. I upgraded to as much plain-text as possible, with some minimal formatting with MarkDown. I use a simple tool to automate the conversion to HTML.

So, no writers are highlighted in the articles. However, I will be forever grateful to these awesome people who contributed to the website;

1. [Deeptaman Mukherjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deeptamanmukherjee/) was the most un-assuming technical writer. He loves technology but is in a profession afar from it. He works in metal industry and has extensive experience in Iron Ore & Aluminium businesses -- raw material procurement, logistics, sales & operations planning.
2. [Kalen Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalen-smith-044b9413/)
3. [Praval Singh](https://praval.com) wrote extensively about Open Source, and unix technologies. Some of his articles went on to become quite popular, and shared a lot.
4. Ritesh Reddy writes at [Reddy2Go](https://www.reddy2go.com) and has contributed quite a bit of interesting articles to my site.
5. [Robin Wilding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-wilding-91456428/)
6. Many other Guest Writers and Contributors.

## 20 Years

After being neglected for many years, I decided to rebuild my website and simplify it to be as close to plain-text as possible. On its 20th anniversary (2021-JUN-11), the site is now as plain-text as possible, sprinkled with the spices of some MarkDown[^MarkDown] and translated by Jekyll[^Jekyll]. [Github](https://github.com) takes care of the Jekyll part to spit out the HTML ([view source](https://github.com/brajeshwar/brajeshwar.github.io)).

I have done away with comments, and dicarded a whole lot of other metadata. I have also deleted more than 250 articles.

[^Flash]: [Adobe Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) (formerly Macromedia Flash and FutureSplash) is a discontinued multimedia software platform used for production of animations, rich internet applications, desktop applications, mobile apps, mobile games, and embedded web browser video players. Flash was initially used to create fully-interactive websites, but this approach was phased out with the introduction of HTML5.

[^Blogger]: [Blogspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)) later known as [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) is an online content management system (CMS) which enables multi-user blogs with time-stamped entries. [Pyra Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyra_Labs) developed it before being acquired by Google in 2003. Google hosts the blogs, which can be accessed through a subdomain of blogspot.com. Blogs can also be accessed from a user-owned custom domain (such as www.example.com) by using DNS facilities to direct a domain to Google's servers.

[^MovableType]: [MovableType](https://movabletype.org) was created by a husband and wife team with a single purpose: to create a powerful solution for the creation and management of web content. An originator of the blogging field, Movable Type offers stability, a user-friendly interface, and beautifully extensive visual customization for websites and blogs.

[^WordPress]: [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) is open source software you can use to create a beautiful website, blog, or app.

[^MarkDown]: [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

[^Jekyll]: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites.
