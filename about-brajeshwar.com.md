The domain `brajeshwar.com` was booked on `Jun 11, 2001`.

I booked the domain on a dare. At work, I once met an expert programmer, who suggested I should write down all the Flash tips, tricks, and things I was doing. That's how it all started. `brajeshwar.com` started as Flash-Website.

I moved on to [Blogspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)), later known as [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), then to [MovableTYpe](https://movabletype.org) (2002), and later to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) (2003) ever since its early beta. I stayed with WordPress for a very long time - about 18 years.

Initially, the site was hosted on few local shared servers. The site really did grew in popularity after Macromedia's recognition. It was cared for by [Media Temple](https://mediatemple.net), [Medium Cube](https://mediumcube.com) (special thanks to [Tamouh Hakmi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamouh/)), [Pagely](https://pagely.com), and [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com) (grandfathered me in a free tier forever).

## Writers

Quite a few writers contributed to brajeshwar.com. Unfortunately, the website is now super simplified. I upgraded to as much plain-text as possible, with some minimal formatting with MarkDown. I use a simple tool to automate the conversion to HTML.

So, no writers are highlighted in the articles. However, I will be forever grateful to these awesome people who contributed to the website;

1. [Deeptaman Mukherjee](https://about.me/Deeptaman.Mukherjee) was the most un-assuming technical writer. He loves technology but is in an profession afar from it. he works in metal industry and has extensive experience in iron ore & aluminium businesses -- raw material procurement, logistics, sales & operations planning.
2. [Kalen Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalen-smith-044b9413/)
3. [Praval Singh](https://praval.com) wrote extensively about Open Source, and *nix technology. Some of his articles went on to become pretty popular, and shared a lot.
4. Ritesh Reddy writes at [Reddy2Go](https://www.reddy2go.com) and has contributed quite a bit of interesting articles to my site.
5. [Robin Wilding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-wilding-91456428/)
6. Many other Guest Writers and Contributors.

## 20 Years

After being neglected for many years, I decided to rebuild my website and simplify it to be as close to plain-text as possible. On its 20th anniversary, Jun 11, 2021, the site is now as plain-text as possible, sprinkled with the spices of some [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and translated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). [Github](https://github.com) takes care of the Jekyll part to spit out the HTML. I have done away with comments, and dicarded a whole lot of other metadata. I have also deleted more than 250 articles.
