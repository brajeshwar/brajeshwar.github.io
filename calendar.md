Please book a schedule of your preference on my calendar. You will get invites from one of my emails `brajeshwar@valinor.earth` (work) or personal -- `brajeshwar@oinam.com` or `brajeshwar@oinam.net` interchangeably.

Trying out [Motion](https://usemotion.com), whose founders are nice people.

If you prefer __Calendly__, my default one still works at [calendly.com/brajeshwar](https://calendly.com/brajeshwar/oinam).

I would really love to be able to use the Open Source, [Calenso](https://github.com/calendso/calendso) (now Cal.com) but it is a bit buggy for my usage.
