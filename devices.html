	I got my first personal phone in 1999 when I migrated from Manipur to Bombay. Here is the evolution of my phone and the phone home screen over the years.

I was not really a watch person.
I was fascinated by the Apple Watch but the inability to have an always-on display was stopping me from having one. So, I waited till series-5. I started with it and used it for about 5 years (2019-2024).

iPad was interesting and had the first version.

Phone in 2005 Sony Ericcson P910i https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_P910
