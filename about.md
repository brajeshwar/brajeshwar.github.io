Hi, my name is Brajeshwar Oinam.

I was born in a quiet and serene, hill-surrounded green valley of Imphal[^Imphal], Manipur (INDIA), and spent all my childhood-school-life, teenage-college-life there.

## Work

I migrated and reached Bombay[^Bombay] on Aug 2, 1999 to kick-start my career. I soon fell in love with the city, the speed, and the pace at which things get done.

After job-hunting for a month, I landed my first job as a Computer Graphic Designer in a Comic Magazine Startup. As part of the test for the job, they gave me a Floppy-Disk[^Floppy-Disk] which contains the files to complete a graphic editing task. In those early days, I was crashing at the Mumbai University Hostel and had no access to a computer. I went about an hour early for the Interview and finished the job at an Internet café[^InternetCafe] nearby. Well, they were impressed with the task and my story on how I completed it. I started work the following week.

> [brajeshwar.com](/about/brajeshwar.com/) was booked on a dare and I'm happy with that decision.

## Internet

It was the Internet boom in India, and the proliferation of the Internet was prominent. I wanted to be part of that world. Within six months through my first job, I shifted my focus to the Online World - started reading lots of books, online resources, and there was no turning back. By mid-2000, I had shifted my focus to the Internet.

## Startup

In early 2003, I resigned from a very lucrative job and started freelancing full-time. During those freelance days, I did many exciting work and enjoyed every moment of it. I learned a lot from those experiences, made many friends, and hitch some of the most rewarding relationships.

By 2005, I decided to take the plunge and started our first company - Oinam Software. We undertook some of the most innovative, sometimes very experimental work for clients, such as
[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com),
[Cambridge University Entrepreneurs](http://www.cue.org.uk/),
[Disney](http://disney.com/),
[Macromedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia),
[Obeo](http://obeo.com/),
[Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/us/),
[STARZ](http://www.starz.com/),
[Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com),
*et al*.

We also worked for many contractors who sub-contracted their work to us. We were, in fact, one of the best ghost developers to many successful Contractors.

In 2006, [Mixercast, Inc](https://www.linkedin.com/company/167518) acquired the Oinam Team. It was an exciting experience, being part of a Startup and learning from it. Unfortunately, [Mixercast](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/mixercast) was dissolved on Dec 31, 2009 after selling its IP (Intellectual Property) to erstwhile Google (now Alphabet).

I had worked with some fantastic companies. I was one of the Creative Directors at [Razorfish](https://www.razorfish.com), and was the Chief Product Officer at [Mobisy](//mobisy.com).

## Family

I've known [Shanta](https://oinam.mom) since 1993. We met again in 2006 while she was an intern at Mixercast. We got [married](/2007/brajeshwar-and-shanta-got-married-on-07-07-07/) in July 2007. We got officially registered in Bombay on 07/07/2007.

We have two daughters, [Laaija](https://laaija.com/) (Dec 2008) and [Amara](https://amara.oinam.com/) (Nov 2016).
