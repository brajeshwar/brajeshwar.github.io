My name is Brajeshwar Oinam.

I was born in a quiet and serene, hill-surrounded green valley of [Imphal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imphal), Manipur (INDIA), and spent all my childhood-school-life, teenage-college-life there.

## Work

I migrated to [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai) in Aug 1999 to kick-start my career. I soon fell in love with the city, the speed, and the pace at which things get done.

After job-hunting for a month, I landed my first job as a Computer Graphic Designer in a Comic Magazine Startup. As part of the test for the job, they gave me a [Floppy-Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk) which contains the files to complete a graphic editing task. In those early days, I was crashing at the Mumbai University Hostel and had no access to a computer. I went about an hour early for the Interview and finished the job at an [Internet café](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_café) nearby. Well, they were impressed with the task and my story on how I completed it. I started work the following week.

## brajeshwar.com

This domain, [brajeshwar.com](/about/brajeshwar.com/) was booked on a dare. I'm very happy with my decision.

## Internet

It was the Internet boom in India, and the proliferation of the Internet was prominent. I wanted to be part of that world. Within six months through my first job, I shifted my focus to the Online World - started reading lots of books, online resources, and there was no turning back. By mid-2000, I had shifted my focus to the Internet.

## Startup

In early 2003, I resigned from a very lucrative job and started freelancing full-time. During those freelance days, I did much exciting work and enjoyed every moment of it. I learned a lot from those experiences, made many friends, and hitch some of the most rewarding relationships.

By 2005, I decided to take the plunge and started our first company - [Oinam Software](https://oinam.software). We undertook some of the most innovative, sometimes very experimental work for clients, such as
[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com),
[Cambridge University Entrepreneurs](http://www.cue.org.uk/),
[Disney](http://disney.com/),
[Macromedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia),
[Obeo](http://obeo.com/),
[Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/us/),
[STARZ](http://www.starz.com/),
[Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com),
_et al_.

We also worked for many Contractors who sub-contracted their work to us. We were, in fact, one of the best ghost developers to many successful Contractors.

In 2006, [Mixercast, Inc](https://www.linkedin.com/company/167518) acquired the Oinam Team. It was an exciting experience, being part of a Startup and learning from it.

[//]: # Unfortunately, [Mixercast](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/mixercast) was declared dead on Dec 31, 2009.

In the winter of 2010-2011, I ran off to Silicon Valley to be part of the [Founder Institute](https://fi.co/join/graduate-Brajeshwar_Oinam) accelerator. I forge life-long friends, connections and learned a lot from that experience.

In 2020-2021, I got into the [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com) Founder Fellowship Program (ODF7). One of the best networks I had ever joined -- the most helpful, fiercely hard-working entrepreneurs, designers, technologists, and all-around brilliant generalists.

I had worked with some fantastic companies. I was one of the Creative Directors at [Razorfish](https://www.razorfish.com), and was the Chief Product Officer at [Mobisy](//mobisy.com).

I continue to leveraging technology in finding solutions to challenges and problems. For details of my professional timeline, view my [Curriculum Vitae](https://cv.brajeshwar.com).

I've known Shanta since 1993. We met again in 2006 while she was an intern at Mixercast. We got [married](/2007/brajeshwar-and-shanta-got-married-on-07-07-07/) in July 2007. We got officially registered in Bombay on 07/07/2007.

We have two daughters, [Laaija](https://laaija.com/) (Dec 2008) and [Amara](https://amara.site/) (Nov 2016).
