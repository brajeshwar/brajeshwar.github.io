The domain `brajeshwar.com` was booked on `Jun 11, 2001`.

I booked the domain on a dare. At work, I once met an expert programmer expert, who suggested I should write down all the Flash tips, tricks, and things I was doing. That's how it all started. My website was a Flash-Website with a Blog.

I moved on to [Blogspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)), which is the current [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), then to [MovableTYpe](https://movabletype.org) (2002), and later to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) (2003) ever since its early beta. I stayed with WordPress for a very long time - 15+ years.

Initially, the site was hosted on few local shared servers. The site really did grew in popularity after Macromedia's recognition. It was cared for by [Media Temple](https://mediatemple.net) for a long time, [Medium Cube](https://mediumcube.com), [Pagely](https://pagely.com), and [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com). Thanks to WPEngine for grandfathering me in a free tier in perpetuaty.

Special thanks to [Tamouh Hakmi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamouh/) for being the most helpful person when it comes to hosting.

## 2021

Being being neglected for many years, I decided to rebuild my website and simplify it to be as close to plain-text as possible. As of `Jun 11, 2021` the site is just text, sprinkled with the spices of some [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and translated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). [Github](https://github.com) takes care of the Jekyll part to spit out the HTML.

I have done away with comments, and dicarded a whole lot of metadata.
