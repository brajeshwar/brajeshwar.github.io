# brajeshwar.com

This is the repository and source that runs my personal website - [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com). The domain, `brajeshwar.com`, was booked on Jun 11, 2001.

The site is a static website generated by Jekyll (since 2021). I wrote an article detailing the journey — [20+ years old site - WordPress to Static](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).

## Todo

- [ ] Check out [Soupault](https://soupault.app). This looks like an ideal tool for what I want to do with my personal website.
- [ ] Replace Google Search with either PageFind or stay with Algolia (I’ve a premium free tier).
- [ ] Move all YouTube Embeds to be plain embeds and stay away from the Jekyll Snippet I wrote. There are `77 matches across 64 files` as of the end of 2023.
	- [ ] Remove unnecessary videos first. If it does not add to the article, remove.
- [ ] `/archives` needs a better interface treatment — a table of content! Perhaps a sitemap hierarchy tree that spits out every link on the website.
- [ ] Table Styles
- [ ] Move `cv.brajeshwar.com` to `brajeshwar.com/timeline`
- [ ] Should we do a `/contact` - use [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com)?
- [ ] Alumni so others can connect with me and hope that I can be of help;
	- [ ] On Deck (Silicon Valley, USA) (2020)
	- [ ] Founder Institute (Silicon Valley, USA) (2010)
	- [ ] Startup Bootcamp (Amsterdam, Netherlands) (2024)
	- [ ] 500 (Aichi, Japan) (2022)
