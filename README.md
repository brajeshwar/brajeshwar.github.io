# brajeshwar.com

This is the repository and source that runs my personal website - [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com). `brajeshwar.com` was booked on Jun 11, 2001.

## Tool

- The site is a static website generated by Jekyll (since 2021). I wrote an article detailing the journey — [20+ years old site - WordPress to Static](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).
- The design, theme, and its source is at [Oinam Jekyll](https://oinam.github.io/oinam-jekyll/).
- Newsletters are not automated but selectively sent via [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/oinam).

## Todo

- [ ] Embed TinyLetter Newsletter in the homepage.
- [ ] Move all YouTube Embeds to be plain embeds and stay away from the Jekyll Snippet I wrote. There are `77 matches across 64 files` as of the end of 2023.
- [ ] Replace Google Search with something simpler.
- [ ] `/archives` needs a better interface treatment — a table of content! Perhaps a sitemap hierarchy tree that spits out every link on the website.
- [ ] Breadcrumbs `brajeshwar.com → About`
- [ ] Move to a simpler build solution, perhaps with Make and Pandoc.
