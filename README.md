# brajeshwar.com

This is the repository and source that runs my personal website - [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com). The domain, `brajeshwar.com`, was booked on Jun 11, 2001.

The site is a static website generated by Jekyll (since 2021). I wrote an article detailing the journey — [20+ years old site - WordPress to Static](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).

## Todo

- [ ] Move all YouTube Embeds to be plain embeds and stay away from the Jekyll Snippet I wrote. There are `77 matches across 64 files` as of the end of 2023.
	- [ ] Remove unnecessary videos first. If it does not add to the article, remove.
- [ ] A cleaner, simpler, custom theme just for the website - start with just plain HTML/CSS, then fork themes out of it.
- [ ] Correct `meta` element such as description for each page (start with the homepage).
- [ ] Replace Google Search with something simpler.
- [ ] `/archives` needs a better interface treatment — a table of content! Perhaps a sitemap hierarchy tree that spits out every link on the website.
- [ ] Breadcrumbs - do I even need it? `brajeshwar.com → About`
- [ ] Tables
- [ ] Templates
	- [ ] Home
