# brajeshwar.com

This is the repository and source that runs my personal website - [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com). The domain, `brajeshwar.com`, was booked on Jun 11, 2001.

The site is a static website generated by Jekyll (since 2021). I wrote an article detailing the journey — [20+ years old site - WordPress to Static](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).

## Todo

- [ ] Check out [Soupault](https://soupault.app). This looks like an ideal tool for what I want to do with my personal website.
- [ ] Replace Google Search with either [PageFind](https://pagefind.app) or stay with [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) (I’ve a premium free tier).
- [ ] `/archives` needs a better interface treatment — a table of content! Perhaps a sitemap hierarchy tree that spits out every link on the website.
- [ ] Move `cv.brajeshwar.com` to `brajeshwar.com/timeline` or make it part of `/about`.
- [ ] Should we do a `/contact` - use [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com)? Or have something common at `contact.oinam.com` or powered by it.
- [ ] Alumni so others can connect with me and hope that I can be of help;
	- [ ] Founder Institute (Silicon Valley, USA) (2010)
	- [ ] On Deck (Silicon Valley, USA) (2020)
	- [ ] 500 (Aichi, Japan) (2022)
	- [ ] [Entrepreneurs for Impact](https://www.entrepreneursforimpact.com) (2022)
	- [ ] Startup Bootcamp (Amsterdam, Netherlands) (2024)
	- [ ] School/College
		- [ ] TTUS (1985-1993)
		- [ ] MPS (1993-1995)
		- [ ] DMC (1995-1999)
- [ ] Bring in the content types, and content in-house to my website for platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram. Remove or Walk-out of anything that makes little sense to be with such as Facebook, Instagram. There is no need for interaction but I should give the opportunities for people looking me to have enough information and contact me. Be social but avoid the crowd. Of course, keep the accounts that I started with - Nostalgia.
- [ ] Setup links to affiliations, Startups, and other entities that I want to promote, and help out.
