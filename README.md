# brajeshwar.com

This is the repository and source that runs my personal website - [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com). The domain, `brajeshwar.com`, was booked on Jun 11, 2001.

The site is a static website generated by Jekyll (since 2021). I wrote an article detailing the journey — [20+ years old site - WordPress to Static](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).

## Todo

- [ ] Image Gallery
- [ ] Replace Google Search with either [PageFind](https://pagefind.app) or stay with [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) (I’ve a premium free tier).
- [ ] `/archives` needs a better interface treatment — a table of content! Perhaps a sitemap hierarchy tree that spits out every link on the website. I like the Reddit's thread design.
- [ ] `cv.brajeshwar.com` as part of `/about`. This should replace my LinkedIn Profile eventually.
- [ ] Should we do a `/contact` - use [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com)? Or have something common at `contact.oinam.com` or powered by it.
