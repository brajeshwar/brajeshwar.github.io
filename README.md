## brajeshwar.com 2025

- I like the simplicity, the well-done design of the single articles of [YaleEnvironment360](https://e360.yale.edu).
	- I like the clean blockquote without any background but enough separation from the rest and the highlight of its presence.
	- The FIGURE and the image content are well placed. The caption is there as part of the picture content without much special treatment.
	- I like their multi-image splits view.
	- Some of their articles;

## Todo

- [ ] `/lab/` for the list of experiments and play stuffs. Don't care much for organization but follow these patterns. `https://lab.brajeshwar.com/project/`, `https://project.lab.brajeshwar.com`
- [ ] Yearly Archives `/2001/`, `/2002/`, etc. https://simonwillison.net/ has a nice way of doing it.
- [ ] Move `/search/` to a dedicated page to reduce the load on others.
- [ ] Search moved from Google to Algolia in `2025-JUN`. Should try [PageFind](https://pagefind.app). I'm hitting Algolia’s monthly limits pretty easily. I like how they do it at https://block.github.io/goose/
- [ ] Page Template (Full Width) - Pages, Photos, Wear, Devices, Books, Films.
- [ ] Page Template (Ideal Width) - posts, articles, ideal for reading.
- [ ] Page template (Timeline) `cv.brajeshwar.com` as part of `/about`. This should also replace my LinkedIn profile eventually.
- [ ] A style component for photos, which highlights some key photos. This will likely come after https://pictures.oinam.com is up.
- [ ] Re-direct `docs.brajeshwar.com` > `https://archive.oinam.com` via Cloudflare Workers.
- [ ] Move all Jekyll Redirects to Cloudflare or plain HTML or just ignore them! Give a good explanation and possible next-step in the 404 page.
- [ ] Move `cdn.oinam.com` items to `brajeshwar.com`.
- [ ] Move YouTube videos to `brajeshwar.com`.
