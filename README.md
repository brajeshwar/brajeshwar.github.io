# brajeshwar.com

This is the repository and source that runs my personal website - [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com). The domain, `brajeshwar.com`, was booked on Jun 11, 2001.

The site is a static website generated by Jekyll (since 2021). I wrote an article detailing the journey — [20+ years old site - WordPress to Static](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).

It is always a `Work-in-Progress`.

## Todo

- [ ] /now/ - "Think of what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in years." Create an intro and then continue with the listicle.
- [ ] Move to a more consistent spacing and typographic scale. Use https://utopia.fyi
- [ ] Replace Google Search with either [PageFind](https://pagefind.app) or stay with [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) (I’ve a premium free tier).
- [ ] `cv.brajeshwar.com` as part of `/about`. This should also replace my LinkedIn Profile eventually.
