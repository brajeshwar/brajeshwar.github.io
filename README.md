# brajeshwar.com

This is the repository and source that runs my personal website - [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com). The domain, `brajeshwar.com`, was booked on Jun 11, 2001.

The site is a static website generated by Jekyll (since 2021). I wrote an article detailing the journey — [20+ years old site - WordPress to Static](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).

## Todo

- [ ] Replace Google Search with either [PageFind](https://pagefind.app) or stay with [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) (I’ve a lifetime premium plan).
- [ ] `cv.brajeshwar.com` as part of `/about`. This should also replace my LinkedIn Profile eventually.
- [ ] Loved the idea of light-dark mode with themes on [Ryan Mulligan's website](https://ryanmulligan.dev). He is also a man of culture - his website is [open-source](https://github.com/hexagoncircle/ryan-mulligan-dev).  Should we do something like that?
