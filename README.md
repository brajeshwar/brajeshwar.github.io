# Brajeshwar

This is the repository and source that runs my personal website - [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com). The domain [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com/about/brajeshwar.com/) was booked on Jun 11, 2001.

## Tool

The site is a static website generated by Jekyll (since 2021). I wrote an article detailing the journey — [20+ years old site - WordPress to Static](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).

The design, theme, and its source is at [Oinam Jekyll](https://oinam.github.io/oinam-jekyll/).
