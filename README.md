# Brajeshwar

This is the repository and source that runs my personal website - [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com). The domain [brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com/about/brajeshwar.com/) was booked on Jun 11, 2001.

## Tool

The site is a static website generated by Jekyll (since 2021). I wrote an article detailing the journey â€” [20+ years old site - WordPress to Static](https://brajeshwar.com/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).

The design, theme, and its source is at [Oinam Jekyll](https://oinam.github.io/oinam-jekyll/).

Newsletters are not automated but selectively sent via [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/oinam).

## Inspiration

These websites are beautiful, bold, different, and awe-inspiring.

- [alexwlchan](https://alexwlchan.net/) is a well organized, clean, personal website.
- [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com) makes visual essays about programming, design, and anthropology.
- [Brett Adcock](https://www.brettadcock.com/bio) is blunt but beautiful and to the point.

### Todo

- [ ] Create a sitemap hierarchy tree that spits out every link on the website `/archives/`. I do not want to be managing this with anything that needs maintainenace. Stay with something well proven or even needed define a pattern that I can follow manually. Can Pandoc be tamed to do this?
- [ ] Contact: Find a way to get form submission with spam protection.
- [ ] Get Search working with Algolia.
- [ ] Highlight Top Articles on the Homepage.
