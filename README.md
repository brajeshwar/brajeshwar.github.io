## Todo

- [ ] `/search/` a dedicated Search Page to reduce the load on others.
- [ ] Replaced Google Search with Algolia in `2025-JUN`. Should try [PageFind](https://pagefind.app). I'm hitting Algolia]s monthly limits pretty easily. I like how they do it at https://block.github.io/goose/
- [ ] Search and “Ask AI” should be a choice defaulting to Search. Use Sagepilot for the AI or an Open source alternative.
- [ ] Re-direct `docs.brajeshwar.com` via Cloudflare Workers.
- [ ] A style component for Photos. Will this be a post sub-type?
- [ ] Yearly Archives `/2001/`, `/2002/`, etc.
- [ ] `cv.brajeshwar.com` as part of `/about`. This should also replace my LinkedIn Profile eventually.
- [ ] Fix 404s
- [ ] Loved the idea of light-dark mode with themes on [Ryan Mulligan's website](https://ryanmulligan.dev). He is also a man of culture - his website is [open-source](https://github.com/hexagoncircle/ryan-mulligan-dev).  Try something like that?

## Promotions & Affiliates

These tools, services, and companies are the ones that I use. I want to promote them, while I link to their affiliates and referral links. It should have a promotional benefit to others who sign-up. I should be using it or have used it and would happily promote.

- [OpenPhone]()
- [Attio](https://www.attio.com?r=IiDWXG7ug6IWeX9n) Workspaces created via the link will receive 10% off Attio for their first year.
