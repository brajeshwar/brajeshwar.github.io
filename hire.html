	<h2>Testimonials</h2>

	<p>
		A transformation project based on the latest technologies does not benefit much from a big team of engineers. It needs a tiny team of super-smart folks led by Brajeshwar.

	</p>
	<p>
		Our interaction and experience have been nothing but extraordinary. Brajeshwar and his team were proactive, nimble and highly capable, which helped us move really fast from ideation to getting the product in our hand within weeks.
