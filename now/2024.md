	- Revamping the design of my website. Focus on designing it with a monochrome color palette, playing with various shades of gray.
	- Reading
		- [Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Women%3A_Exposing_Data_Bias_in_a_World_Designed_for_Men) by [Caroline Criado Pérez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Criado_Perez)
		- [My Dad’s a Birdman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Dad%27s_a_Birdman), a 2007 children’s illustrated novel, by [David Almond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Almond)
		- Re-read [1984](/2024/1984/) real quick and it remains one of that dystopian book that can scare you while preparing for a totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of people and behaviors within society.
	- Finally figured out who the seriously funny woman is — [Diane Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Morgan). I’m currently laughing through the mockumentary television series - [Cunk on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunk_on_Earth), and [Cunk on Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunk_on_Britain).
