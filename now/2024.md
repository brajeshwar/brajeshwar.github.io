# 2024

- Aug
	- I experimented building the `jekyll build` for Github Pages with the [Jekyll Github Workflow](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/) and it is working so far. I’ll stay as lean and minimal as possible with the least plugin possible, and with the least dependencies on third-party tools.
	- I’ve added this [NOW](http://localhost:4000/now/) page to [Derek Siver’s](https://sive.rs) NowNowNow at [nownownow.com/p/7r9Q](https://nownownow.com/p/7r9Q).
	- I’ve been reading many non-fiction books for a very long time. My rough guestimate puts fiction against non-fiction to about 1:5. This year, I’ve decided to get back to slow-lazy-reading with fiction books. I will re-read many of the novels I used to read as a young adult.
	- Reading
		- [The Sands of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sands_of_Time_%28Sheldon_novel%29) by [Sidney Sheldon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Sheldon). The action novel follows the adventures of four women who are forced to leave their Spanish convent for the outside world of threat, violence and passions; and two men who are pitted against each other in a fight to the death.

	- Revamping the design of my website. Focus on designing it with a monochrome color palette, playing with various shades of gray.
	- Reading
		- [Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Women%3A_Exposing_Data_Bias_in_a_World_Designed_for_Men) by [Caroline Criado Pérez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Criado_Perez)
		- [My Dad’s a Birdman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Dad%27s_a_Birdman), a 2007 children’s illustrated novel, by [David Almond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Almond)
		- Re-read [1984](/2024/1984/) real quick and it remains one of that dystopian book that can scare you while preparing for a totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of people and behaviors within society.
	- Finally figured out who the seriously funny woman is — [Diane Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Morgan). I’m currently laughing through the mockumentary television series - [Cunk on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunk_on_Earth), and [Cunk on Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunk_on_Britain).

	- Pitching [Valinor Earth](https://valinor.earth/) in Amsterdam for the [Startup Bootcamp](https://www.startupbootcamp.org) Demo Day, which was held as part of the Pitch Session at [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com) on Jun 20, 2024.
	- [Met with Vikrant Aivalli](https://x.com/brajeshwar/status/1811610910298972419), a colleague from the early days of my Startup life (2006-2007). We had lunch at [The Pancake Bakery](https://pancake.nl), in Amsterdam.
- Feb
	- I applied to [Startup Bootcamp](https://www.startupbootcamp.org) for Valinor Earth. After three rounds of Interview, we were accepted into the program on Feb 27, 2024. [Katerina Korotkova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katerina-korotkova-b73a5b8/) called me on WhatsApp to inform us of the acceptance.
- Jan
	- Organized by their school, I went on a trip with my daughter, Amara, to the Bidarakatte Trek in Bangalore. It was fun and she loved it.
