Quite a few authors contributed to brajeshwar.com. Unfortunately, the website is now super simplified. I upgraded to as much plain-text as possible, written in MarkDown to elevate some of the formatting. I use a simple tool to automate the conversion to HTML.

So, no authors are highlighted in the articles. However, I will be forever grateful to these awesome people who contributed to the website;
