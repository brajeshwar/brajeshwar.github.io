		My life’s item should be in a single printable A4 size Paper at a readable font-size and perhaps even blocks of boxes to not try to cramp in too much item. Create a layered modular capsule wardrobe, and stay within a monochrome color, without or as minimal display of logos, no-frills and no-brand.

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_wardrobe">capsule wardrobe</a> is a minimalist collection of clothes that can be put together in different ways to cover a variety of outfits and occasions. The aim is to have an outfit suitable for any occasion without owning excessive items of clothing. This is usually achieved by buying what are considered to be “key” or “staple” items in coordinating colours.
