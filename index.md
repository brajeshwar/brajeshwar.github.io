Hi, I am Brajeshwar Oinam.

I have been writing since 2001. I write about productivity, technology, entrepreneurship, startup life, and design.

## Work

I co-founded <a href="https://valinor.earth">Valinor Earth</a> with two of my close friends, with whom I have worked on multiple projects and companies. We build sustainable and profitable technology practices helping businesses curb climate change.

## Entrepreneurs

I will listen to your ideas, problems, and I won't judge. The best ideas are fragile; most people don't even start talking about them because they sound silly. Perhaps most of all, you want to be around people who don't make you feel stupid for mentioning an awful idea and who certainly never feel silly for doing so themselves.

You can practice your pitch, ask questions about your product, talk about product design, user-interfaces, and user experiences.
