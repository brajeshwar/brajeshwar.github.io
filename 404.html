<h1 class="text-center">Page Not Found (404)</h1>
<p class="text-center mark">Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist.</p>

<p>
	There can be a lot of reason for this embarrassment. Some of the likely ones are;
	<ul>
		<li>The page actually do not exist.</li>
		<li>The page was deleted. Sad.</li>
		<li>You followed a wrong link, or something did not check the link if that works.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>So, what next?</h2>

<p>
	You can do one of these few options;
	<ul>
		<li>Hit the <kbd>BACK</kbd> button on your browser to go where you came.</li>
		<li>Go to the <a href="/">Homepage</a> of this website.</li>
		<li><a href="/#connect">Email me</a> and I will fix it.</li>
	</ul>
