<h1>Please Confirm Subscription</h1>

<p>
	I’ve sent you an email with a confirmation link. Please click the link in your email before you can sign up for my <a href="/newsletter/">newsletter</a>.
</p>

<h2>But Why!</h2>

<p>
	This is called a double-opt in — and it’s important;
	<ul>
		<li>It stops robots from signing up to the newsletter.</li>
		<li>It stops people from being added to the newsletter without their permission.</li>
		<li>It stops people from accidentally signing up with a typo.</li>
		<li>It stops people who don’t really really want to be signed up from signing up.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	This is great for me, because it means I pay less money to host the newsletter, and won’t end up on a list of spammers.
