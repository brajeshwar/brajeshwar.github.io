# Weekly Finds

Started at the 26th Week of 2025 but Iâ€™m back-dating from the 1st week of 2025 with the bookmarks that I started collecting about a year back. Just a way for a cleaner organization with no particular reason.

The most ideal way would have been to treat them as collections. But I want the simplicity of decoupling it from anything that needs this to run on its own. Jekyll still converts it to HTML like all the other posts but it should be able to stand on its own as plain-text (MarkDown) that can be converted to HTML by any tool in future or I will just write in plain HTML.
