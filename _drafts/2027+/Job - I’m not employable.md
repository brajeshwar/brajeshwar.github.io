# Job - Iâ€™m not employable

I realized I have never been hired the normal way!

It was either the founder/owner taking a bet after seeing my work or some weird incident.

I have worked for 5 companies/employers in my career, with a total of about 7 years.

1. 1999, DI Publications, Comic Book Startup. Because of the Floppy Disk in Internet Cafe incident.
2. 2000, Mega Motion. I pluck out the Easter Egg Photo from Photoshop and did some edit while waiting for the Interview. Owner/Founder saw it and gave me the job.
3. 2002, Healthcare company, Alok. Because of my work in Flash, which was noticed by the Employee No. 1.
4. 2014, Razorfish. Founder of the company acquired by Razorfish knew me from my work online and in the developer community.
5. 2019, Mobisy. A lead designer, who was leaving, ask me to come in and do some mentoring/consultation. Was later asked to be lead the Product Team.
