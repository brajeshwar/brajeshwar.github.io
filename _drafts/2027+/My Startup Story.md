Macromedia Lego Event in San Francisco, 2005.
One of our cohort came on a boat.
Did a demo of his route.
Wondered, "That is brilliant. What does he do?"
He is a “Startup Founder”

Peldi of Balsamiq rode down in an awesome Bike to meet up.
Next year, my Service company was acquired by a Silicon Valley Startup.
