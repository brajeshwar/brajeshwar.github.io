# Rituals, Not Habits

Habits are things we do that get so ingrained that they become automatic. They come with familiar urges to do something, usually triggered by a cue. We might have the urge to check our phone for messages, emails, and likes as soon as we wake up each morning (or when we get a notification). 

Routines require more commitment to maintain. For many of us, going to the gym or intermittent fasting are routines; we have to make a conscious effort to maintain them, or else we’ll stop. 

Rituals require the most intention. Rituals have meaning beyond the action itself; they celebrate the purpose, the “why” of a repeated action. A daily meditation practice or even a few moments of quiet while solving the New York Times crossword can be rituals that give us comfort and joy. 

Colloquially, we think of a ritual as something we do regularly and in the same way every time. Definitions aside, a ritual has a few key characteristics:

1. **It’s intentional.** You consciously engage and are present. 
2. **It’s participatory.** You’re active rather than passive.
3. **It’s meaningful.** It’s valuable beyond the action itself or any utility. It’s often emotional—e.g. nostalgic, fun, celebratory, identity-forming.
4. **It’s consistent.** It’s reliable in timing, expectation, quality, etc.
5. **It’s finite.** There’s a constraint around time, effort, or action itself.
