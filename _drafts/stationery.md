# Stationery

I grew up studying my early years with an ardent lack of stationery. I still remember buying a used fountain pen from a friend and it became my priced luxury item.

The lack of the bare necessities of stationery needed for my education remained a fear. My fear is cemented by many nightmares that I have to this day of various scenarios of me or my daughters without the much needed stationery when the time called for.

Now, I can afford to buy and I have an excessive indulgence to buying many stationery items, and then backups of the items, along with stashes of secondary backups of them. I want stationery to be one item that my daughters should never worry about.
