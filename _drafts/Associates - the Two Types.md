# Associates

Investment Associates, principle,

There are two types of Associates.

The ones that augment an Investor - knows the ins and outs, and can hunt and peck data to backup an investor. This person is a financial ninja.

The brash, mostly-rude, “I’m a VC” type associates, who are kinda deragatory to founders and their own investment firm.
