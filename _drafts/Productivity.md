# Productivity

All the best of productivity boils down to these key points.

1. Do Less Ruthlessly; but Do it Better. Maintain a To-Don’t List alongside the To-Do List. Just write it down without doing.
2. Protect your Peak Hours. When is my brain the sharpest. Ideally early in the morning. Find out when is this for me.
3. Think Less, Automate like a Machine, especially for the small stuffs. Systematize. Stop Multi-tasking. Batch tasks. Limit your choices. Less is More. If I don’t have to think what to wear, I’m not worried.
4. Track your Progress. If Sunday/Monday is asking what am I doing this week, then Friday is the day I ask what happened, what was my progress. Track everyday, every week, month, quarter, and years.
5. Track Strategic Breaks. Breaks are tools of excellence.
6. Consistency instead of Intensity, Habits instead of Heroics. Just Show Up, don’t be a Hero. Intensity Exhausts; Consistency Compounds.
