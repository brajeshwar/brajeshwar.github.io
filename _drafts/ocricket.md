# oCricket

I have lots of memories with oCricket. The mistakes, the learnings, and the team that work together.

I finally sold the domain on Feb 14, 2023. I hope someone does something good with it and it lives on.

Started in 2006 with an idea, and came to fruition in 2009.

I sold another oCricketâ€™s asset on Oct 11, 2023. A Cricket Score WordPress plugin that has been lying around untouched since 2009.

Now, there is nothing more left of oCricket except for the memories, the nostalgia.
