# A Simpler, Future-Proof, Plain Text Life

"data-first with tools on top"

I’ve developed patterns to streamline and simplify, pretty much everything in my life.

I’m always on the look-out to simplify my digital activities and usage. I’m on a Mac, so this article will reflect a macOS language but the philosophy and ideas should be applicable to other Operating Systems too.

Plain text is software and operating system agnostic. It's searchable, portable, lightweight, and easily manipulated. It's unstructured. It works when web servers are down, or when the Internet is not working. There's no exporting and importing, no databases or tags or flags or stars or prioritizing or any other proprietary induced rules on what you can and can't do with it.

It is used for tasks, notes, drafts, journal, which will help you manage your work with minimal overhead.

I still use Plain Text, but don’t hesitate to write in [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). MarkDown is well established, open, and really easy to jump in. This makes it easy for any tool to read it, better yet if it can parse MarkDown.

## The Advantages of Text Files

Plain text works everywhere, all the time, and will likely do so well into the future. It will not require an upgrade, a subscription, an app, an account, a purchase.
Plain text files are the most flexible file format ever. They can be opened by any tool or program or app or the Command line.
Easily Portable. Works on all Operating Systems.
Text Files are Future-Proof.

## The Disadvantages of Text Files

The User Experience is not that good. It is entirely dependent on the tools that can support.
No Rules. Harder to be disciplined in maintenance.

My effort is to evolve to a much simpler life, either digital or otherwise, try to use the least number of tools, just stay with the essentials.
