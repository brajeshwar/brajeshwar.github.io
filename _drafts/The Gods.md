This may be fictions but it resonated with me. I like to take the path less trodden.

Once upon a time, in the life of Hercules, he came to the crossroads. The road diverged lay a beautiful goddess who offered him every temptation he could imagine. Adorned in finery, she promised him a life of ease. She swore heâ€™d never taste want or unhappiness or fear or pain. Follow her, she said, and his every desire would be fulfilled.

On the other path stood a sterner goddess in a pure whilte robe. She made a quiter call. She promised no rewards except those that came as a result of hard work. It would be a long journey, she said. There would be sacrifice. There would be scary moments. But it was a journey fit for the god. It would make him the person his ancestors meant him to be.
