# Web Design

"Design" is "This button should be 56px wide, have 8px of padding and be colored `#4590ff`".

"Product" is "We are are building an app to let users listen to podcasts, and we should show a list of recommended next podcasts with a button beside each to play, but default to autoplaying the next one if no user interaction happens."

"Product research" is "Our users frequently listen to podcasts in the car, so they may need hands-free interaction and will want to listen to the next track without user intervention."

"Visual brand" is "Across all of our products, we like to use a simple white background, with dashed-line dividers between list items and `#4590ff` primary call to action buttons, each of which has 8px of padding and 4px rounded corners."

"Design systems" is "Across all our products, use a list whenever you have a collection of homogenous items. If the list represents an audio multimedia track, use this music icon that we have uploaded to the general library. The currently playing audio track should have a moving audio signal display to indicate its selected status."
