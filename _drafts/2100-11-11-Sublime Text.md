# Sublime Text

I don't do much of development anymore and I'm too lazy or in-inept to learn Emacs or VIM.

Started in the same year it was released 2008 and bought the first license in 2009 and have renewed couple of times, the last one in 2020.

I tried to replace it but keep coming back.
I can open my entire drive and keep editing files around and it just works.
