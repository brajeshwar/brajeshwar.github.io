[Corporate Memphis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Memphis) (aka Alegria, Globohomo) is a style of illustrations that features extrahuman attributes, such as non proportional bodies and non-existing skin colors. It has been credited to Facebook, and was explicitly made to be modular (as in designers are replaceable).

This style has strong connotations of cynical corporations, eerie feelings of minimalist facelessness, toxic positivity and an anxious alignment with current political winds, clear enough to minimize scrutiny but vague enough to be entirely unactionable. The mood words are growth hacking and user engagement.

## Own the Content, use any tools

Whoever you use, Medium, Substack, Wordpress, your website is in their hands. If one day you forget to do XYZ task, they can take it all away.
You need to control your audience to reduce chances of "unforeseen circumstances".

There has been enough instances of platforms dying, pivoting, or just plain ignoring their users. It is OK to use a platform, but own the content or a backup of it that you can "walk away if needed." So, owning your own domain and perhaps pointing it to the blogspots, substacks, and WordPresses of the world as a tool is a OK. One day, you will need to relocate to another platform or tool(s).
If you own your own domain, and own the content, you can just walk out and it will still be alive. This is assuming that your content are more important (to you) than the platform.
Once, WordPress was the new MovableType/Blogspot, Medium the new Wordpress, and now Substack the new Medium. You never know.
