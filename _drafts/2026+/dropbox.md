# Dropbox

[Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox) is a file hosting service that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software. Dropbox was founded in 2007 by [Drew Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Houston) and [Arash Ferdowsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arash_Ferdowsi).

Dropbox was officially launched at 2008’s TechCrunch Disrupt. Dropbox’s official domain name was `getdropbox.com` until October 2009, when it acquired its current domain, `dropbox.com`.

I’ve been using Dropbox since its `getdropbox.com` days, earning quite a lot of free space via its popular referral program. Dropbox was my primary file-storage and sync across devices. I’ve been a paying customer since its early days (I believe 2007 or 2008) until JUL-2025.
