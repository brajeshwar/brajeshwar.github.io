# One-Person Businesses

One-Person Business, Solopreneurs are nothing new. This was indeed the default since time immemorial. With the advent of AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools and utilities, it has given new meanings and capabilities.

## AI Business Partners

Generative AI is no longer just a productivity tool; it has become a de facto co-founder. From coding to marketing and design, solo founders are automating core business tasks. The results are faster time to market, dramatically lower overhead, and unprecedented agility.

According to a 2024 report by First Round Capital, 28% of new startups in their community had a single founder, up from just 13% in 2018. This shift is partly credited to AI tooling reducing the need for specialized co-founders in the earliest stages. AI also helps eliminate traditional operational bottlenecks—tasks like customer support, bookkeeping, and even legal document creation can now be handled through tools like ChatGPT plugins, DoNotPay, and AI-based contract analysis software.

The 2023 Indie Hackers report found that over 60% of solo founders use AI daily in tasks ranging from content generation to product development and customer support. In many cases, these founders reach six-figure revenue milestones without ever hiring a team.

Take the case of Daniel Vassallo, a former Amazon engineer, who built a portfolio of solo microbusinesses earning over $500,000 annually through info products, job boards, and community platforms—all managed with minimal outside help. His use of automation and AI tools lets him run lean, make fast decisions, and retain full control.

Similarly, research from a16z’s Future blog highlighted that many early-stage founders are choosing to delay hiring and external funding, relying instead on AI to scale until product-market fit is clear. This lean, AI-assisted approach aligns well with the solopreneur model. Tools like Bubble, Make.com, and OpenAI's APIs are now used as building blocks by solo entrepreneurs who previously needed developers or entire product teams.

## Easier to Start

AI flattens the learning curve across disciplines. A non-technical founder can now build apps with no-code platforms enhanced by GPT-based logic. A technical founder can launch with marketing, SEO, and social copy powered by AI writers. Even growth hacking and A/B testing are increasingly handled by AI agents that can learn and iterate.

The barriers to launching are not just lower—they're disappearing. Solopreneurs today can:

- Build landing pages with tools like Framer or Carrd, enhanced with AI copy.
- Create logos and brand identities via Looka or Midjourney.
- Launch and manage paid ads through AI ad generators like AdCreative.ai.
- Perform SEO optimization with Surfer SEO, NeuronWriter, or Outranking.

## Start

In a world where one person can prototype, iterate, and ship products at scale, the definition of a startup team is being rewritten. Solopreneurs, armed with AI, are testing ideas faster, growing audiences directly, and owning 100% of their equity.

This isn’t just a trend—it’s a transformation. Investors are beginning to pay attention too. TinySeed and Calm Company Fund now back solo founders, and platforms like Gumroad and Substack have proven that individuals can build both creative and scalable tech businesses alone.

According to a 2024 Stripe Atlas report, over 50% of new companies incorporated via their platform in Q1 2024 had a single founder. This reflects a broader cultural shift—individuals are not just capable of launching businesses; they're expected to do so with speed, style, and software.

## 

Expect a future where founders don’t look for a technical or business partner—but spin up an AI-powered assistant instead. In this new frontier, the solo founder isn't alone. They're just augmented.

As the tools get better, cheaper, and more intelligent, the power to build impactful businesses will sit not with companies—but with individuals. The solopreneur isn’t just the future of business. In many ways, it’s already here.
