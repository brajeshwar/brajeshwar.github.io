# Ephemerality

Nothing lasts forever. A few do, however, last for a long time, the best being a few decades, especially in the digital world.

[^ephemerality]: [Ephemerality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemerality) is the concept of things being transitory, existing only briefly. Academically, the term ephemeral constitutionally describes a diverse assortment of things and experiences, from digital media to types of streams. Because different people may value the passage of time differently, ephemerality may be a relative, perceptual concept: “In brief, what is short-lived may not be the object itself, but the attention we afford it.”
