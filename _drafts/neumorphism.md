# Neumorphism

Neumorphism is a design style commonly identified by a soft and light look, sometimes referred to as “Soft UI”, with elements that appear to protrude from or dent into the background rather than float on top of it.

Neumorphism combines elements of Skeuomorphism[^Skeuomorphism] and Flat Design[^Flat-Design] elements to deliver a more streamlined user experience. Buttons and images often have slight shadows and subtle color gradients along with familiar designs, but without the in-your-face familiarity of first-generation Skeuomorphs.
