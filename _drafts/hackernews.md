Gather interesting links during the day.
When the west coast wakes up and before I retire for the day.
Don't get emotional - the same links you submitted will die but someone else submitting it after a day or two will get voted.
Submission of a single article every 10-15 minute interval (timer) or burst of 4-article each every 20-25min. Sleep and wake up the next day, an article or two gets in the front.

My timing is before I go to sleep in India-Time (8-9PM). Sometimes, I post some remainders from the night before early in the morning if I have extra time in between making breakfast and preparing my kids for school.
