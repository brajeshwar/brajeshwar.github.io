# Feature vs Product Builders

I have been part of many products that started from an idea, went on to iterate through failures, mistakes, and then grind out through the messy middle, to finally delivery the product to be used by millions if not billions of users.

I see types of builders - feature builders and product builders. They are the archtypes - specialist and generalist.

We need both.
