# Stoicism and Philosophy in Product Design, Development, Startup, and Entrepreneurship

1. Virtue Over Vanity Metrics. As a Startup, think of the long term when you are hugely successful, then walk backwards from there and build towards that. Yes, there will be experiments, pivots, and failures but focus on ethics, durability. Success at the longer horizon beats chasing short-lived growth hacks.
2. Resilience as the Most Underrated Startup Metric. How enduring setbacks is often more important than innovation speed. Speed Thrills but kills.
3. The Ship of Theseus and the Ever-Evolving Codebase. A thought experiment on whether a product that’s entirely rewritten is still “the same” product — and what that means for brand, UX, and trust.
4. Designing for Ephemerality. Accepting That All Software Will Die
Preparing products and teams for inevitable obsolescence while still building with pride.
5. The Zen of Feature Deletion. Why removing features can improve product focus, performance, and user trust.
6. The Tao of Product-Market Fit. Seeing PMF as a balance between user needs and your product’s essence, not a one-time milestone.
7. A Stoic’s Guide to Navigating AI Hype Cycles. How to build AI products without being swayed by market noise and exaggerated promises.
8. AI as the New Oracle—And Why We Must Question It. Parallels between ancient oracles and modern AI — and the need for critical thinking.
9. Virtue Ethics as a Framework for AI Decision-Making. How Aristotle’s ethics can help AI teams make morally sound product choices. The Art of Saying “No” to Shiny New Tools. Why chasing every new framework or AI API often kills focus and depth.
10. Choosing Principles Over Short-Term Growth. Founders and PMs making product calls with long-term integrity over quarterly wins.
