# Painful Problems are Assets

From the Book, “How to make a few billion dollars,” by Brad Jacobs

Look, Brad, if you want to make money in the business world, you need to get used to problems, because that’s what business is. It’s actually about finding problems, embracing and even enjoying them — because each problem is an opportunity to remove an obstacle and get closer to success.

Later in the book, Brad says that “problems are an asset — not something to avoid but something to run toward.”


People want to avoid pain and indulge in pleasure.

A pattern with some Startups that are producing flashy demos with very low customer engagement.  They are usually solving occasional problems.

An example is “use natural language to query a database”. 

Most employees at a tech company don’t actually write SQL queries every day. They might want to write a query once a month and struggle with the syntax. This is an occasional problem.

Data scientists, on the other hand, write SQL queries every day, but the solution they’d want is a power tool for data scientists. It would probably have version control, performance monitoring and collaboration features. Not a chatGPT style interface for hobbyists and beginners.

LLMs are really shining right now where they are applied to repetitive work that’s done by teams of human for 8+ hours a day.
