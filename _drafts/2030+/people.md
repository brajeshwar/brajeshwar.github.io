I'm indebted to many people. They had helped me when in need, without asking any questions, and guided me in many ways. I'm forever thankful to them. Here are a few of them, whom I will never stop admiring.

Lokeshwor "Uncle" was my first mentor, who introduced me to some of the most intriguing aspects of computers. I met him for the first time, in 1995, in a Computer Institute where I was working and teaching part-time. We debated the future of computers and the Internet way before we had access to the Internet. He encouraged me to tinker with both the computer software and hardware alike. He is no more. I will miss his talks and enthusiasm.

[Saurabh Chandra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabhchandra/) was my erstwhile boss when he was the CEO of Razorfish, Bangalore (INDIA). He is currently the co-founder, CEO of Ati Motors -- a robotic company. I learned a lot from him, especially how to be patient and make the extremes work together.
