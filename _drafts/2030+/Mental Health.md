# Mental Health

Broken Family before 10-years.
No Food to eat.
No Shoes to Wear
Paid for my own studies/education.

Surprised that people cannot even fathom tiny changes from their comfort zones.
My Family can neither, so I understand.
All these Mental Health Apps are just short-term bandaids. Of course, you can start with it but learn to do it naturally, witout medicines, aids, or apps.
