# CrowdStrike - a Fire Sale

“Everything must go.”

It all started with what it seemed like sporadic road accidents across the globe. Then it happened, the centralized transportation control rooms started behaving erratically and weirdly unpredictable. The transportation systems were failing - traffic lights were no longer working as expected, the train controls were out of control, and the airport systems failure began to ground all Airplanes.

Then came the financial systems - credit cards failed, transactions were stalled, the banks stopped working.

Hospitals began showing signs of non-working systems; they can no longer take care of critical patients — everything needs to go manual — paper charts with Checklist Manifesto. All things seems to be going down - the electrical grid is erratic, communication channels are compromised and satellite systems are going haywire.

It’s a Fire Sale.

Referred to as a Fire Sale in the movie Die Hard 4.

A fire sale is the sale of goods at extremely discounted prices. The term originated in reference to the sale of goods at a heavy discount due to fire damage.  They are said to occur in the financial markets when bidders who value assets highly are prevented from bidding on them, depressing the average selling price below what it otherwise would be.

On 19 July 2024, CrowdStrike distributed a faulty update to its security software that caused an estimated 8.5 million computers and virtual machines running Microsoft Windows to crash. The affected computers — mostly business and governmental machines — were unable to properly restart, disrupting critical and other services around the globe. The outage has been described as the largest in the history of information technology and "historic in scale".

The outage disrupted airlines, airports, banks, hotels, hospitals, manufacturing, stock markets, broadcasting, and more. Governmental services, such as emergency services and websites, were also affected.

The error was discovered and a fix released within hours, but because each affected computer had to be manually reset, outages lingered on many services.
