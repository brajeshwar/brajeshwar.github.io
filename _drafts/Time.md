# Time

People systematically undervalue their time.
Find high leverage activities, solve hardest problems, increase efficiency, and use incremental units of time wisely.

Focus on high leverage activities 

- The definition of a high leverage activity is something with a small injection of your time, energy, or resources can massively impact lots of people. That’s one of the reasons I like full company meetings every week. [Read More](https://www.notion.so/ba2f26eb94e14224af258c28a42d059b?pvs=21)
- If you've read High Output Management, it's a combination of high-output management and allocation of time. And so the most important lesson is to be consciously aware of what time you're consuming and how to get the most possible leverage, or benefit, or output out of that time.

- Our calendars don't really help, even though they're software. They may actually be making people dumber. Basically, people use software as a calendar, and they fill in slots, as opposed to optimizing and leveraging time. [Read More](https://www.notion.so/ce7b0d254c7b4796b3aa62ed93b7a3f5?pvs=21)

Solve hardest problems

- You have a checklist of things to accomplish. Most people have an A+ problem, but they don't know the solution. So they procrastinate on that solution. And then they go down the checklist to the second or third initiative, where they know the answer and they'll go solve those problems and cross them off.

- You have to ascribe a significant value to every increment of time, whether it's a minute, an hour, you can divide it however you like. But fundamentally, ask yourself, "Is this worth it? Is this the best thing I can be doing with my time?" [Read More](https://www.notion.so/5217287f67d642cbb7ab5263cc0e06f5?pvs=21)
- I hired a personal assistant with the goal of eliminating from my schedule every day anything that wasn't like a high-leverage activity. I was basically spending from maybe 50% or 60% of my time in a week allocated to things I cared about to being 85%. [Read More](https://www.notion.so/5217287f67d642cbb7ab5263cc0e06f5?pvs=21)

## Increase efficiency

- I do look for efficiency within time. So when I'm going to, let's say, invest in training or working out, I do think about what's the most effective use of incremental time. So what's the most I can achieve in one hour? And then look for solutions for that. [Read More](https://www.notion.so/5217287f67d642cbb7ab5263cc0e06f5?pvs=21)
- I would always try to trade money for time, and then allocate the time to the most interesting, most provocative, highest upside, highest challenge thing you can do with that time, and constantly cycle yourself through “How do I do more and more and more of that?” [Read More](https://www.notion.so/5217287f67d642cbb7ab5263cc0e06f5?pvs=21)

## Use incremental units of time

- Sometimes the best thing to do with an incremental unit of time might be to sleep, actually. But other times, the best allocation might be to double down on something else you're already doing. And the people who have a good feel for that tend to thrive. [Read More](https://www.notion.so/c82dd12ac1914f11af7862d760129f9e?pvs=21)
- It’s important to understand when there's something good enough that the marginal benefit of your time and attention to it isn't really worth it. If you're a perfectionist about everything, you may not be able to achieve some really great things because you do have to sort of take your eye off the ball on some things that are just more commoditized.

Define your priorities, allocate time accordingly, and review priorities everyday.  

- [The single most common characteristic that the people who really succeed have is their ability to constantly prioritize time. It's almost innate.](https://www.notion.so/ce7b0d254c7b4796b3aa62ed93b7a3f5?pvs=21)

- [You have to have a pre-existing view about what's important to you. Like, is it professional success, family, health, fitness, whatever, but you have to come up with your top two or three priorities first. And then it's like, "How do I systematically ensure that I'm allocating my time to meet my priorities?"](https://www.notion.so/5217287f67d642cbb7ab5263cc0e06f5?pvs=21)
- [The only scarce resource you have in your life is time. Measure your progress for satisfaction in shorter doses and look for leverage of what you can say no to and not do, or what you can delegate or pay other people to do for you so that you can do the things that are most important, most valuable, and most productive for you.](https://www.notion.so/601968f6b3674df8b99b0ffee12b007f?pvs=21)

- [I force myself to prioritize strictly and then allocate time according to my priorities. And everyday I’m triaging time against against my priorities.](https://www.notion.so/0cd4d093f9244e599650488c0a2ee91c?pvs=21)

### Review priorities everyday

- [We all have a natural human tendency to achieve psychological satisfaction by crossing some things off the list every day.
