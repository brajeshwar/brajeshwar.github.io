Email is always the first and best communication medium, and I'm happy to get cold emails. I love thoughtful cold emails and would definitely reply. Please, tell me know who you are and your message be clear, and short that grabs attention with a specific ask, an offer, an actionable item, or, well perhaps just a “Hi”.
