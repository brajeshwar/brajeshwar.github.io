# Please Confirm Subscription

I've sent you an email with a confirmation link — before you can sign up to the newsletter you'll need to click the link in your email.

## But Why!

This is called a double-opt in — and it's important;

- It stops robots from signing up to the newsletter.
- It stops people from being added to the newsletter without their permission.
- It stops people from accidentally signing up with a typo.
- It stops people who don't really really want to be signed up from signing up.

This is great for me, because it means I pay less money to host the newsletter, and won't end up on a list of spammers.
