title: Do not send me that worm, please
---

Couple of people seem to be infected with `W32.Sobig.F@mm` worm, I have received a bit more than 15 mails with the worm though my Norton Antivirus 2003 was able to block it off at the gate and remove the same. 

Please make it a habit to download the latest virus definitions for your Antivirus and check for the same regularly. Their mail subjects were like "need help", "why is the live preview not working", "can I send my FLA", everything related to flash. I am still receiving many mails at the time of writing this thread.
