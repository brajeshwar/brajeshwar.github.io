<p>All the way long, I had been thinking that Camtasia Studio Recorder can output only a max of 320 x 240 resolution. But I am wrong, now you can broadcast whatever dimension I wish. As there is no easy way to do an application sharing or a desktop sharing directly with Macromedia Flash Communication Server MX 1.0/1.5, <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/" title="techsmith">Camtasia Studio</a> comes to the rescue with its live record output feature.<br />
<br />
First you may download the <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/downloads/flashmx/camtasia/camtasia.zip">file</a> (I was playing with) so that you can skip everything and start playing.</p>
<p>Steps :<br />
(a) create a video object on your stage and size it to 640 x 480, give an instance name of say "camtasia_mc".<br />
(b) add the following frame script</p>
<p>bc[as]. //let us get the Camtasia Studio Video Capture Driver<br />
//you may throw up an array of camera source available and<br />
//let the user choose from them<br />
//for this, we know what we are doing, so let us get it<br />
for (i = 0; i < camera.names.length; i++) {<br />
 if (camera.names[i] == "Camtasia Studio Video Capture Driver") {<br />
  break;<br />
 }<br />
}<br />
// Get the camera<br />
mycamera = camera.get(i);<br />
mycamera.setMode(640, 480, 5, true);<br />
mycamera.setQuality(0, 50);<br />
//show the live output<br />
camtasia_mc.attachVideo(mycamera);</p>
<p>(c) start live recorder and remember to set the video format to 640 x 480 (In the Camtasia Recorder Program, Tools > Option > Live > Default Video Format and Choose 640 x 480 )<br />
(d) run your Flash document.<br />
There you see your live feed coming out in the Flash document. This same technique cam be used for any camera source, like a TV Tuner card which can in turn broadcast a TV channel live using Flashcom Server.</p>
