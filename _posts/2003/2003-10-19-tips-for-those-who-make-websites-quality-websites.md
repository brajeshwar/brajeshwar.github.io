title: Tips for those who make websites, quality websites
---

I have been trying hard during weekends to make this site a bit more easy to navigate, more usable and more toward standards. I think the [quality tips](http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/) for webmasters from w3.org would be a useful read for many who maintains blogs.

The title is one of the most important element of a quality web page, more to this effect to talked over at the Central dev chat during the weekend and Oscar Trelles showed some more light in the same direction. Don't use "click here" as link text, use h1 for top-level heading, do not forget the alt attribute otherwise it will not even validate on most doctypes, stay on a harmonious color scheme for your site, make more readable URIs et cetera. There are many nice tips worth reading them time and again.

Useful articles, links on web standards, must DOs for Web/Internet Application developers;
