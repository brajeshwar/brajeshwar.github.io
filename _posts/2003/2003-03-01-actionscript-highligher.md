# Actionscript Highligher

Ah! I discovered this damn too late. I am trying to use Actionscript highligher, and yes an easy one to implement at that and Arul was kind enough to point me to the right url for my requirement, AS highlighter for PHP (an ASP version is also available there). There is also a good one [beautifier](https://beautifier.org).

The strange finding I got was a credit to my site (if I am not wrong), though the spelling was mispelled "Thanks to breshjar.com for MX Functions Listing". Well, I thought nobody was interested in my listings which I used it mainly for my favorite text editor. I do not have any update to that at the moment save for the old one which I will update may be by the end of March with all other missing ones, including Flash Communication Server MX server side and client side scripts.
