There was a tool to turn Flash on and off from a web page. I did not like that because of some reason which I have forgotten. That was <a href="http://www.jtedley.com/jtflashmanager/index.php" title="JT Flash manager">jTFlashManager</a>, many people use that and I am not against that in any way though. But today I found a rather easy to install, easy to use and a real good one for turning Flash on or off during your development. Check out Flash Switch and download the same if you haven't. It sits there in your system tray on a Windows/PC machine and you can turn on or off your flash content on your browser, just remember to refresh your browser if you are doing turn on/off then and there while viewing a Flash content site.
