# Flash Paper

With the release of [Contribute 2.0](http://www.macromedia.com/software/contribute/), Macromedia came with something else cool called the "Flash Paper". At current the editing of Flash Paper is supported only on Windows 2000/XP though it will play under any platform which have Flash Player 6.0 and above plug-in. Flash paper can be generated from any application that can print.
