# Macromedia Flash MX Certification (Designer)

The MX Certification Voucher gifted by Macromedia was lying around for quite a while. Recently, I decided to try it out. I know it is easy and far less inferior to the developer examination but then I am yet to come to a level to even think of the developer certification, so I went in for the designer certification.

I'm now a Macromedia Certified Professional.
