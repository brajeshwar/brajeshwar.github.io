# Selectoracle / CSS 3

Have you ever wondered and be amazed at other people's cool, geeky css selectors, attributes and surprised that you have missed many of them, specially those new CSS 3 thingy which is around for quite sometime? Well, I found a url that exactly does some explanation for what those geeky slectors mean, have a look at SelectORable, just paste your (or other people's for that matter) css and let it do the explanation.

While we are on this, you may also like to refer to the [CSS 3 selectors](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/) from [w3c](http://www.w3.org)'s website, and you may bookmark this [CSS 2.1 draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html) too, very similar to the CSS2 but with a slightly better explanation.
