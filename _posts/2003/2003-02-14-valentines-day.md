title: Valentine's Day

So, today is <a href="http://www.valentine.com/" title="visit the valentine website">Valentine's Day</a>, working a bit late in the night or rather more appropriately very early in the morning, I started receiving the usual daily newsletter from many subscription including that of <a href="http://www.wired.com/" title="visit wired online">wired</a>. Their first article for today is <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,57660,00.html">Study: Couples Love Kissing Right</a>.

I went there to read them and the other articles too, quite a good info there. Sometime, I feel I should roam and wander away from Flash, Flash sites, Flash Designs, Flash Codes and Flash friends. While you are there, visit the kissing tips section and the <a href="http://www.kissingbooth.com/kissingfacts.htm" title="kissing facts section">kissing facts</a>.
