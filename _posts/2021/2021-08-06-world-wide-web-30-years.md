# The World Wide Web - 30 Years

![WWW - Try It)](/static/2021/www-try-it.jpg)

Today, we take the `World Wide Web` (the Web) for granted - a utility as ubiquitous as electricity.

On this day, Aug 6, 1991, [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb) posted [information](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.archives/c/CfsHlSNYPUI/m/DTs60INnuzcJ?pli=1) about his [WorldWideWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb) project to the public and introduced the Web to the world.

> The WWW project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to 
make an easy but powerful global information system.

Tim Berners-Lee wrote `WorldWideWeb` during the second half of 1990, while working for [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN), a European nuclear research agency. The first successful build was completed by Dec 25, 1990, after two months of development. The browser was announced on the newsgroups and became available to the general public in Aug 1991.
