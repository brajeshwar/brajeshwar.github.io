Earlier this year, I decided to slow down and read fewer books while dwelling deeper into topics and re-reading books of particular interests.

# A

[Antifragile: Things that Gain from Disorder](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

# D

[Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) by Cal Newport

# H

I stumbled on [Haline](https://www.amazon.com/Haline-Sundeep-Ahuja-ebook/dp/B00HK3KNK2/) by [Sundeep Ahuja](http://www.sundeepahuja.com) while looking up investors in the Climate-Tech, AgTech sector. Haline is a book that paints a vivid picture to the question, "What if we do nothing?" This is one of those Hollywood post-climate-change movie story. The book is definitely a seed for an upcoming movie; [Sundeep Ahuja](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2412848/) is indeed an actor, producer.

Haline is a stark look at a post-climate change future, a world licking its wounds after decades of war and famine in which resources are scarce and government tyrannical. It is the answer to the troubling and timely question: What if we do nothing?

[How to Avoid a Climate Disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Avoid_a_Climate_Disaster): The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need by Bill Gates

I like the writing of [Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson) and I re-read his biography of [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci).

[Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.amazon.com/Leonardo-Vinci-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1501139150) by Walter Isaacson is a thick book and I spent months reading it.

# M

[Merchants of Doubt](https://www.amazon.com/Merchants-Doubt-Handful-Scientists-Obscured-ebook/dp/B005QBH2SQ/) by Naomi Oreskes,  Erik M. Conway

# R

[![Mahatma Gandhi)](/static/2021/mahatma-gandhi.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi)

[The Story of My Experiments with Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth) - An Autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi.
The book is free to read at the Mahama Gandhi archival website - [Book PDF](https://www.mkgandhi.org/ebks/An-Autobiography.pdf) ([backup](//cdn.oinam.com/pdf/book-mahatma-gandhi-the-story-of-my-experiments-with-truth.pdf)).

[The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming](https://www.amazon.com/Uninhabitable-Earth-Life-After-Warming/dp/0525576703) by David Wallace-Wells

[The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World-dp-0670022756/dp/0670022756/) by David Deutsch
I heard Naval Ravikant praising the book in a Podcast. This is a hard book for mere mortals like me -- goes tangential, repetitions, and pretty complex writing. I might need to re-read this get deeper.

[The Psychology of Money](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-hardback-Timeless-happiness/dp/0857199099/) by Morgan Housel.
