The Personal Computer has come a long way. 40 years on this day (AUG 12), IBM announced their first Personal Computer - The IBM Personal Computer (Model 5150). The [Press Release](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc25/pc25_press.html) was published on Aug 12, 1981. The majority of modern personal computers are distant descendants of the IBM PC.

> Designed for business, school and home, the easy-to-use system sells for as little as $1,565. It offers many advanced features and, with optional software, may use hundreds of popular application programs.

The base configuration had 16K RAM, Color Graphics Adapter, but no disk drives.

OS/2 Museum has a nice article, [The IBM PC, 41 Years Ago](https://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-ibm-pc-41-years-ago/), on how it all started a year prior. A very detailed and interesting article, complete with hand-written design drawings and diagrams, specs, and internal working details.

It is nice going down memory lane. I started my first interaction with a computer with an IBM PC with an Intel [i386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386) in 1992.
