[Bluesky](https://blueskyweb.org), an initiative started by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) to decentralize social media. They are building the social web by connecting disconnected silos and returning control of the social experience to users. They are developing technologies for an open and decentralized public conversation on the web. [Jay Graber](https://jaygraber.com) is at the helm, leading the team.

Twitter co-founder, [Jack Dorsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey) ([@jack](https://twitter.com/jack)) started the [conversation](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106) in late 2019;

> Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard.

They have a [discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/YmrHBhCuFa) for early adopters or join the [public community](https://bluesky-community.net).
