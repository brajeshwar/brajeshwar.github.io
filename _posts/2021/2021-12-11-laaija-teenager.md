# A Gen-Z Teenager

My [daughter](https://laaija.com), born digital native, is now a teenager -- a [Generation Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z).

It is an entirely different world out there for the digital-native kids - their lives are a blend of the digital and physical world. The conversation that started in the physical world transcends into the digital and vice versa. Even the very idea of owning an item in the physical world is as equivalent as owning a digital one.

For instance, a Gen-Z humor can change real fast that by the time you read this, something might have changed. Here is a video trying to explain Gen-Z humor sometime in 2020.
