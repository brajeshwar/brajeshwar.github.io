# brajeshwar.com (2021)

The website has come a long way - well - 20 years. It started as a Flash Site in 2001. I moved on to [Blogspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)), later known as [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/), then to [MovableType](https://movabletype.org) (~2002), and later to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) (~2003) ever since its early beta. I stayed with WordPress for a very long time - about 18 years.

I have done away with comments, and dicarded a whole lot of other metadata. I have also deleted more than 250 articles. Now, articles are just the `# Title` and the content; `no tags`, `no categories`, `no jazz` at all.

> In 2001, the domain, `brajeshwar.com` was booked on a dare and I'm happy with that decision. [Read the Story](/about/brajeshwar.com/).

## Jekyll + Github Pages

With over 1200 posts, Jekyll Server was really slow. It took north of `10sec` to reflect the changes. I even tried [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) which is super-fast. However, I wanted a simpler solution. I stuck out with Jekyll and deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). Well, once the design was done, I <mark>DO NOT</mark> have to run Jekyll while writing; if I want to preview, a MarkDown previewer is enough. Better yet -- take a break, make tea or coffee and come back for the rendered site. ;-)

During the early days, I wrote all sorts of crap. Many a blog post could have been a tweet but then, there was no [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brajeshwar).

I ended up designing a clean, simple, and minimal Jekyll Theme. The theme is open-sourced - [Oinam Jekyll](https://oinam.github.io/oinam-jekyll/). Feel free to use it, contribute or do anything you want.

It has the must-have and minimal [plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/) to get the basics of writing and blogging work. Anything beyond what is there must be added after careful consideration.
