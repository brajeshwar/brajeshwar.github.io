# Kill Billâ€™s Browser

It looks like the whole rage against Internet Explorer have started again with wilder fury. I just saw Boing Boing's post about [Kill Bill's Browser](http://www.killbillsbrowser.com/). 

They have *13 hilarious Reasons to Swtich from Internet explorer to Firefox*.

Not only that, there is also the [Explorer Destroyer](http://www.explorerdestroyer.com/). Their claim is that for each person you switch, [Google](http://www.google.com/) gives you $1, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) loses marketshare, and an angel gets its wings.

Personally, I am not really against Internet Explorer or any browser for that metter though I prefer Firefox as my primary browser. I use Internet Explorer 5, 5.5 and 6.0 to check site compatibility during development, besides Opera 8.5, Netscape 8.0 and the newly released Developer version of [Flock](http://www.flock.com/). My site still stats about 70% visitors with Internet explorer while Firefox a meagre 25%, the remaining are shared between Safari, Opera, Netscape, Mozilla, Camino and some feed reader, crawler agents.
