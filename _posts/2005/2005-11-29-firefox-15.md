# Firefox 1.5

Ever since its first release candidate (Firefox RC 1), I have been a big fan of the new improvements in <a href="http://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a>.

Some of the cool features;

- Drag and drop reordering for opened tabs.
- Non-obstructive error message (You can do that with firetune for pre-1.5 versions).
- Support for Web Standards including SVG, CSS2, CSS3, and JavaScript 1.6.
- Easier options for the security settings.
- Force links that open in New Window to open in a new Tab instead.
