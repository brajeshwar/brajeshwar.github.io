excerpt: Eclipse, Eclipse Web Tools Platform, Text Editor, WYSIWYG

<p>Based on experience, further twisted by personal choice, I have multiple version of "Eclipse (Eclipse)":http://www.eclipse.org/ - Default (test bed), Zorn, Flash. Very recently, I have a new addition *WTP* or the "Eclipse Web Tools Platform (Eclipse Web Tools Platform)":http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/.</p>
<p>*Why not Dreamweaver?*</p>
<p>_Personal_<br />
"Dreamweaver (Dreamweaver)":http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/ is a fantastic software and is one of the best Web Development Tool. Unfortunately, looking at my own usage history, I have never used Dreamweaver ever since the MX version. Nonthless, it gets installed as a part of the Studio Package. Upon evaluation, the only tool that is used on a regular basis is "Flash (Flash)":http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/.</p>
<p>_Team_<br />
In a Team Development environment, every individual have to have a license and Macromedia Studio do not allow splitting the license. If you have a single license for Stuio 8, it cannot split the Flash and Dreamweaver licence between 2 developers even if either of them uses Flash and Dreamweaver separately. Nonthless, one can buy individual Dreamweaver (Dreamweaver 8 cost $399) licences for the developers but for a not-so-big Team like "ours (Oinam Software)":http://www.oinam.com/, it is a considerable price to pay everytime a new developers is added to the team.</p>
<p>Another factor in the decision was that our ColdFusion Team uses "CFEclipse (CFEclipse)":http://www.cfeclipse.org/, and the Flash Team uses "Eclipse and Flash Plug-ins (Eclipse and Flash Plug-ins)":http://osflash.org/open_source_flash_projects#eclipse_and_plug-ins. Thus, Eclipse becomes the preferred choice for Web Development too and with the fact that "WTP (WTP)":http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/ is Free, made us choose the same.<br />
<br />
*What is Eclipse Web Tools Platform?*</p>
<p>Eclipse Web Tools Platform project extends the Eclipse platform with tools for developing J2EE Web applications. The WTP project includes the following tools: source editors for HTML, Javascript, CSS, JSP, SQL, XML, DTD, XSD, and WSDL; graphical editors for XSD and WSDL; J2EE project natures, builders, and models and a J2EE navigator; a Web service wizard and explorer, and WS-I Test Tools; and database access and query tools and models.</p>
<p>Tools provided will include editors, validators and document generators for artifacts developed in a wide range of standard languages (for example, HTML/xHMTL, Web services, XQueries, SQL, etc.) Supporting infrastructure will likely comprise a specialized workbench supporting actions such as publish, run, start and stop of Web application code across target server environments.</p>
<p>*Some Use Cases as defined on the WTP site*</p>
<p>* Develop and publish a static HTML site<br />
* Develop Web pages based on JavaScript and CSS<br />
* Deploy an applet on a given HTTP server<br />
* Develop SQL statements and generate static Web pages from database queries<br />
* Develop XSD and XSLT for XML based Web pages and Web services<br />
* Develop and publish WSDL schema on UDDI registries<br />
* Explore UDDI registries and dynamically test Web services via WSDL<br />
* Test Web services for WS-I compliance</p>
<p>Well, that is even a bit more than what is needed. If you rather code and love text editors more than a "WYSIWYG (WYSIWYG)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WySiWyG tool, "WTP (WTP)":http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/ is not a bad choice at all. I had been a die hard fan of my Favorite Text Editor, "Textpad (Textpad)":http://www.textpad.com/ and had been using it since early 2003. But it has its limitations and I am not more easier, comfortable with *WTP*.</p>
