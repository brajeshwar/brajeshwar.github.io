I was asking a list about the release of FCS 2 and then I heard news of Macromedia "announcing (macromedia announces Flash Media Server 2)":http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2005/announcing_flashmediaserver2.html their "Flash Media Server 2 (Flash Media Server 2)":http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashmediaserver/productinfo/features/ formerly known as Flash Communication Server. What a timely announcement!

Flash Media Server 2 introduces new scalable Edge-Origin servers, an optional, enterprise-ready architecture that simplifies load balancing, failover and clustering. Flash Media Server 2 video experiences take advantage of the new high-quality video codec in Flash Player 8, complete with automatic detection of the client's bandwidth connection and capability to adjust the stream accordingly.

Flash Media Server 2 is likely to priced around $4,500 for a two-CPU configuration Professional Edition license and is expected to ship in October 2005. I heard that people are beta testing this server, code-named "Edison" and the public beta is expected to be available in September 2005.
