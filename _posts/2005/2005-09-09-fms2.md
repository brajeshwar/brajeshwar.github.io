<p>I was asking a list about the release of FCS 2 and then I heard news of Macromedia "announcing (macromedia announces Flash Media Server 2)":http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2005/announcing_flashmediaserver2.html their "Flash Media Server 2 (Flash Media Server 2)":http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashmediaserver/productinfo/features/ formerly known as Flash Communication Server. What a timely announcement!</p>
<p>Flash Media Server 2 introduces new scalable Edge-Origin servers, an optional, enterprise-ready architecture that simplifies load balancing, failover and clustering.

<p>Flash Media Server 2 is likely to priced around $4,500 for a two-CPU configuration Professional Edition license and is expected to ship in October 2005. I heard that people are beta testing this server, code-named "Edison" and the public beta is expected to be available in September 2005.</p>
