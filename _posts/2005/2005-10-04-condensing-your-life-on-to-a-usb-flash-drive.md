Everybody reads "Slashdot (Slashdot)":http://slashdot.org/, so I won't really repeat the article but this one caught my attention. The articles talks about, "How to Prepare for One Really Quick Getaway (How to Prepare for One Really Quick Getaway)":http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/01/business/01docs.ready.html?pagewanted=print which appeared in "New York Times (New York Times)":http://www.nytimes.com/ on the first of October.

__What is the first thing you will grab from your home if your house floods, catches on fire or comes tumbling down in an earthquake? Family photos? The pets? The Hummel figurines?__

They have a word doc, "YourMoneyList (YourMoneyList)":http://www.nytimes.com/packages/other/business/YourMoneyList.doc, that will help you or anyone in your family locate things you need for the insurance adjuster or relief worker, *Just In Case You Get Hit by a Bus*.
