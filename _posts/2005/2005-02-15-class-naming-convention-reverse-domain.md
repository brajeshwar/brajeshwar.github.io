excerpt: The reverse domain naming convention  is very unique. This becomes more prominent
  if we are to distribute our codes, work within a team of developers.

<p>Well, there are still questions that we consider understood and took no further discussion. Today, a friend asked me why most people use the reverse domain name for class package naming convention; @com.oinam.util.MyClass@.</p>
<p>Well, it is because of the fact that this naming convention is very unique. This becomes more prominent if we are to distribute our codes, work within a team of developers.</p>
<p>Following the defined convention, the prefix of our packages should always be written in all lowercase plain ASCII letters (well, we still don't have a domain names with $, # or * yet), and they should be of the top-level domain names viz: com, edu, gov, mil, net, org (you are also allowed to use one of the English two-letter codes identifying countries as specified in ISO Standard 3166, 1981).</p>

<p>The other part of the package name is usually the project name or a company's division, department, machine, login names or commonly used packages like "util", "arcade".</p>
<p>Thus, a typical class, say "MyClass" with the class definition "com.oinam.util.MyClass" would have been in the folder "util" which is inside "oinam" which resides on the top folder "com". Structurily, @com > oinam > util > MyClass.as@</p>
