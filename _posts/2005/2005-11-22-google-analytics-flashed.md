title: Google Analytics Flashed
---

I always believed that Google is more about non-flash and more of `XMLHttpRequest`. `brajeshwar.com` is on [Mediatemple](http://www.mediatemple.net/) and they have urchin for the site stats and I know that Urchin had nothing flashy about them. I use more of [Mint](http://www.haveamint.com/) to study the statistics but I am sure I will be more on Google Analytics for more details.

I signed up for [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/) recently but the tracking started today and I was amazed at the cool interface, the detailed reports. Well, most of the reports, graphs, etc. are done in Flash. I am pretty sure there's more to it than just meets the eye but it is cool to see Flash being used in one of the most appropriate style.
