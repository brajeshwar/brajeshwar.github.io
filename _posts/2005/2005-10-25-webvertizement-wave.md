# Webvertizement Wave

Is it just me or the World Wide Web is gaining on the advertizement momentum in a bigger way again. Coupla days back, I saw an article in the aggregators about the [Million Dollar Homepage](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/) which consists of 1 million individual pixels. Each pixel is valued at $1 a piece with a minimum purchase requirement of a 100 pixel block (10 x 10 pixels).

Today I saw Jason from [37Signals](http://37signals.com/) and [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/) wrote about [The Deck](http://www.coudal.com/deck/). Formed by [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/), [37signals](http://www.37signals.com/) and [Coudal Partners](http://www.coudal.com/), `The Deck` is the premier advertising network to reach out to the web and design professionals.

[Simple Thoughts](http://blog.taragana.com/) reported that Google and its network partners sites displaying its Adsense accounted for most of the company's earnings. Google posted [revenues of $1.578 billion](http://www.internetweek.com/172303218) for the quarter ending Sep 30, 2005, up 96% from the third quarter of 2004.
