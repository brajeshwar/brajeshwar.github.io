title: Star Wars III, Revenge of the Sith
---

Wow! The visuals were stunning, very real-like and superb, though I wasn't that surprised after the preparation for such an encounter with all the good reviews floating around. I was finally able to do justice to my movie-thirst after watching "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith [Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith](http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/) today, I could not make it to the First day as I was plagued all day with a Flash ActionScript Workshop at the [Aptech](http://www.aptech.ac.in/) Training Head Office, Mumbai. 

__Revenge of the Sith__ tell the story of the rise and fall of Darth Vader aka young Skywalker aka Anakin (Hayden Christensen) who eventually become the Sith Lord in his effort to save his wife Padme (Natalie Portman). He dreamt that his wife died during child birth and the only way to save her (that was what he thought) was to learn the trick-of-the-trade of the dark side. He was tricked into the dark side by Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who indeed turn out to be Darth Sidious.

There were many nice saber fights, specially between Anakin and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). I will not try to add further and spoil your urge for the movie; I will definitely be collecting the whole of Star Wars Episodes for my DVD Collection and perhaps watch them in sequence.
