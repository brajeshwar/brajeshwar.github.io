Crazy Frog is a character used in the marketing of a ring tone based on [The Annoying Thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Frog), a computer animation created by Erik Wernquist. Marketed by the ringtone provider Jamba!, the animation was originally created to accompany a sound effect produced by Daniel Malmedahl while attempting to imitate the sound of a two-stroke moped engine.
