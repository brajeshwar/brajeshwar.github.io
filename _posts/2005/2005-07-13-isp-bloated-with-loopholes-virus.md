title: ISP bloated with Loopholes, Virus
---

Very recently, as our company moved in to a bigger office, we went for an Internet connection from the premier Internet Service Provider in India, [VSNL](http://www.vsnl.com/) or the Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited. Doing so, one of their requirement for the registration was my mail ID which I gave trusting them as one of those 'technical-advanced-techies-helping-us'. 

Unfortunately, ever since then, I am flooded with virus infected e-mails which are all from the different employees of VSNL.

Luckily for me, they are caught by our Anti-Virus which we are very serious about. Now, we are not sure at whose hand are we trusting our technology upon. Our team could do nothing but to laugh off.
