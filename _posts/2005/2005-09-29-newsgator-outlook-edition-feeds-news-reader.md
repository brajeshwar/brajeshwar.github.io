title: Newsgator Outlook Edition - Feeds, News Reader
---

I am surprised why haven't I come across "Newsgator Outlook Edition (Newsgator Outlook Edition)":http://www.newsgator.com/ before? I had my newsgator subscription account after it "acquired (NewsGator Technologies Acquires FeedDemon)":http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=58 FeedDemon but I never used the same. I had been searching for a newsreader (NNTP) plug-in for Outlook 2003 for quite sometime, I even found some but none live up to their promise. I went out today again on Google to do a search and stumble upon "NewsGator Outlook Edition 2.5 (NewsGator Outlook Edition 2.5)":http://www.newsgator.com/.

Outlook Edition is a cool software, very professional, plugs into Outlook, synchronizes with your online feeds at Newsgator and will ultimately be able to do away with "FeedDemon (FeedDemon)":http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/ (I have to have FeedDemon open most of the time to check the loads of Feeds!). They even have "Plug-ins and Extensions (Plug-ins and Extensions)":http://www.newsgator.com/plugins/ that allows you to post to your blogs ("Blogger (Blogger)":http://www.blogger.com/, "Movable Type (Movable Type)":http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/, "Typepad (Typepad)":http://www.typepad.com/, and a bunch of others).

Another cool thing that struck me with the Outlook Edition was that it can read NNTP Newsgroups. Wow! Newsgator cured two of my itches today. I used to use Outllok Express to read Macromedia's NewsGroup. Btw, currently I read only Macromedia's NNTP (MM's NNTP Server: forums.macromedia.com).
