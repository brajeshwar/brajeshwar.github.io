<p>I finally got my "Crazy Frog Crazy Hits (Crazy Frog Crazy Hits)":http://www.crazyfroghits.com/ music CD. Released in India very recently (rather late), they somehow don't have the enhanced version which have the password to access the site at "Crazy Frog Hits (Crazy Frog Hits)":http://www.crazyfroghits.com/.</p>

<p># Intro<br />
# Axel F<br />

# Whoompi (There It Is)<br />
# 1001 Nights<br />
# We Like To Party<br />
# Don't You Want Me<br />
# Dirty Frog<br />
# Magic Melody<br />
# Pump Up The Jam<br />
# In The 80'S<br />
