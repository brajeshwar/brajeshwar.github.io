excerpt: With the word "Charlotte", Ben goes to the Arctic and thus finds the ship
  under the frozen ice, with the nameplate that read "Charlotte." This is where the
  parties separated when Ian Howe (Sean Bean, the 006 of Golden Eye, Boromir of Lord
  of the Rings and Odysseus, King of Ithaca of Troy) decide to go on with himself
  and even kill Ben. The findings on the ship lead Ben to steal the "Declaration of
  Independence" and read the cryptic codes and the map on the back of it, which was
  written in invisible ink. Well, this was where Ben met the beautiful National Archivist,
  Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger, that beautiful Helen of Troy). She later team up
  with Ben till they found the treasure.

<p><a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/nationaltreasure/"><img src="/static/2005/01/nationaltreasure.jpg" alt="National Treasure" /></a>Are you one of those who like the book <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/archives/2004/07/cracking_the_da.php" title="Da Vinci Code">Da Vinci Code</a> and its alike genre of the recent craze across the globe, break codes, then this movie will make you sit back, think over as if the book have come alive in this movie. I heard that the Da Vinci Code is being filmed to be released this year, so <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/nationaltreasure/" title="National Treasure">National Treasure</a> definitely ain't that one. It is being released across India tomorrow, I went to see the premiere today.</p>
<p>National Treasure is about an ancient treasure, protected by the Knights Templar and the Masons, and hidden for centuries until Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) starts to follow many clues to find the treasure. His father, Patrick Henry Gates (Jon Voight), is not really interested in finding the treasure which had come down from generation to generations in the Gates family. His role as a father might remind you of Tomb Rider playing father to his daughter, Angelina Jolie. It was Ben's grandfather (Christopher Plummer who played Aristotle in <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/archives/2004/12/alexander.php" title="Alexander">Alexander</a>) who gave him a clue handed down through the generations ever since the last surviving signatory of the Declaration of Independence of the United States, that the whole treasure hunting for Ben started.<br />

<p>The climax came in when after many chasing, decoding, deciphering, in some sorta underground mine beneath a tomb. Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) provided the comic relief in between with his geeky attitude but histotically dumb save for his much-needed knowledge of the fact that Day-light saving came to light only after the first world war.</p>
<p>If you love codes, crypts, Da Vinci Codes, Rage and Angels, Dan Brown and Nicholas Cage, not necessarily in that order, go ahead and enjoy the movie. And now it is time to wait for the DVD to arrive and see deleted scenes, how the movie was made etcetera.</p>
