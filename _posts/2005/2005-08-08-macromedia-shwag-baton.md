<p>In keeping with the Macromedia Shwag baton passing tradition, after I was handed it coupla days back by "Matt Voerman (Matt Voerman)":http://www.rocketboots.com.au/blog/, I am proud to list out mine.</p>
<p>May be this is akin to my nature, but I am not really comfortable showing them off (well, for anything I possess for that matter) and thus keeps most of them to be used only for the appropriate time/place. Being an <a href="http://www.adobe.com/communities/experts/">Adobe Community Expert</a> (erstwhile Macromedia Team Member), manager of "iGeeks (iGeeks)":http://www.igeeks.org/ and a much pampered developer of Macromedia Technologies, I am lucky to get many if not HUGE Macromedia Collectibles! As for the ones intended for the Macromedia User Groups, I am tired of distributing them as it never finishes. I would like to slip a quick thanks to Edward Sullivan for the same. Mike Chamber is another person responsible for most of my possessions and a heap of thanks goes to him.</p>

<p>BTW, let me take this opportuity to ask if anybody is willing to sell off *FutureSplash, Flash v1.0, Flash 2.0, Flash v3.0, Flash v4.0 and Flash v5.0*. I want to buy them. I am more interested in the box and the software even if you have lost the licence (I won't be using it).</p>
