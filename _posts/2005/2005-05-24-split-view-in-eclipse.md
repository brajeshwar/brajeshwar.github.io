# Split View in Eclipse

Select the file editor you want to split and choose "Window > New Editor". Eclipse will open a new editor tab on the same file as you are currently editing. You can now drag and drop the new editor tab to the side of the editor pane where you want it. The two editor tabs will automatically stay synchronized.
