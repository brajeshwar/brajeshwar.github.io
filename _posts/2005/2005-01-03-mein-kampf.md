<p><img src="/static/2005/01/meinkampf.jpg" alt="Mein Kampf" />While spending some time at the book-store before the movie "Alexander (Alexander)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2004/12/alexander/ starts, I thought of buying some books. I have seen Mein Kampf before but never thought of buying it, may be because of the history that I learnt as a kid, where Hitler was the evil geniuse of his time. But then a book is never bad if you can read it with a fair judgement in your mind. "Mein Kampf (Mein Kampf)":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0395925037/qid=1104490928/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-2394036-1739141?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846 gives an insight into Adolf Hitler, his political ideas, his beliefs, his motivations and his struggle to consolidate Germany into one great nation.</p>
<p>The book have two volumes (A Retrospect and The National Socialist Movement); the first volume was written in 1924 when Hitler was serving a sentence of detention for thirteen months in the Fortress of Landsberg am Lech, following the verdict of the Munich People's Court of that time, the second volume was written when he was released from the prison. Adolf Hitler is believed to be highly influenced by two people, Dr. Leopold Potsch, who taught him German Political History and Dr. Jorg Lanz Van Liebenfels, a defrocked monk who founded the Temple of the New Order.</p>
