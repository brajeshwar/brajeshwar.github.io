# What is/isnâ€™t Web 2.0?

O'Reilly have a nice article on [What is Web 2.0](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html) and Jason point out [The top 10 things that aren't Web 2.0](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/the_top_10_things_that_arent_web_20.php).

PJ Heyett seems to know [exactly what web 2.0 is ](http://pjhyett.com/articles/2005/10/03/priceless-definition-of-web-2-0). He says it is;

- pretentious
- oversized fonts
- pastel colors
- buzzwords
- featureless user experiences
- overly friendly and self-important copy
- acronyms
