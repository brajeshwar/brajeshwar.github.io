It is also learnt that Macromedia's 8.1% stake in Mumbai-based mobile gaming company, Indiagames, is moving to "Adobe India (Adobe India)":http://www.adobe.co.in/ too. A combined stake of 18.2% in "Indiagames (IndiaGames)":http://www.indiagames.com/ was acquired by "Macromedia (Macromedia)":http://www.macromedia.com/ and "Cisco Systems (Cisco Systems)":http://www.cisco.com/ for $4m from existing Investor "TOM Online (TOM Online)":http://www.tom.com/ recently.<br />
