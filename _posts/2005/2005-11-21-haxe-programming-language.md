title: haXe Programming Language
---

Here is something that you should keep a tap on! [haXe](http://haxe.org/) is a programming language from the [mtasc](http://mtasc.org/) guy and I would really be interested into looking closely at something that comes from him. The haXe programming language is one supposedly a common language for the different technologies; server side, client side and rich clients (read Flash, Flex here).

haXe can;

- create Flash SWF files using Flash APIs for Players 6, 7, 8, 8.5.
- generate Javascript code using Browser DHTML API, so you can create AJAX web applications.
- generate Neko sourcecode that can be used on the Server side or in standalone executable.
