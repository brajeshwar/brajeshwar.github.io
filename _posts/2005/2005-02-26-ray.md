<p><img src="/static/2005/02/ray.png" alt="Ray" />The other day, I went to watch the biopic of Howard Hughes, the "Aviator (Aviator)":http://www.miramax.com/aviator/. Well, learnt that Mr. Hughes is one hell of a guy; leaving aside his sorta super-sensitive craziness part. He shoots his film "Hell's Angels" for over 4 years and few of the airplane fight scenes himself from an airplane.</p>
<p>The funny and cool episode was that of his movie "The Outlaw". That bra design of Jane Russell's, which the censor board then refused to give a certificate for public viewing. He eventually won though with the help of a measuring caliper.</p>
<p>Following in the genre of biopic that I watched this season is "Ray (Ray Charles Robinson)":http://www.raymovie.com/. After watching and liking Jamie Foxx in "Collateral (Collateral)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2004/10/collateral.php, I was, like everybody else, amazed with his portrayal of a totally different persona. I enjoyed the songs, the concerts in the movie more than his story of heroine use, courting women on the tour.</p>
<p>While visiting the Music Store, I bought "Ray Charles's Genius Loves Company (Ray Charles's Genius Loves Company)":http://www.geniuslovescompany.com/</p>
