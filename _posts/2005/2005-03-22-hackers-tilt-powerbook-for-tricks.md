# Hackers Tilt PowerBook for Tricks

Today Wired.com had an article [Hackers Tilt PowerBook for Tricks](http://wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66936,00.html). The article eventually makes you sit up and read through the finer lines, think over on how things are shaping around the world we live in.

An excerpt from the article states, "Enterprising hackers have discovered that because the new motion sensor returns reasonably accurate measurements to Mac OS X, it can be used to do some cool tricks, from realigning an image in a window so it always points up, no matter what angle you hold the laptop at, to controlling what's playing in iTunes -- rock the machine backward to go to the next track, forward to play the previous one."
