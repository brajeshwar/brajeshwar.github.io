title: FLVPLayer from FlashGuru

---

[Guy Watson](http://www.flashguru.co.uk/) has a nifty tool, [FLVPlayer](http://www.flashguru.co.uk/free-tool-flash-video-player/) which associates itself with FLVs on a windows box. With this FLVPlayer installed, double clicking on any FLV will launch it and play the FLV.
