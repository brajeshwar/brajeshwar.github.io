excerpt: I looked at the Credit Roll more closely and I saw my name, Brajeshwar Oinam,
  along with some of the best Flash Developers in the world. This is cool!

<p>Am I usually the last one to know good things happening with Flash, specially with Flash 8? I saw the video of the "Making of Flash 8 (Making of Flash 8)":http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/flash/video/team/ and I could see that I was nowhere to be seen in the scope. Ok, not a problem as I never knew they will use the footages for such a cool video.</p>
<p>But then, I saw "Lord Alex (Lord Alex)":http://www.lordalex.org/2005/09/macromedia-flash-8-credits-special.php on the Flash 8 credit roll. So, also, "Jesse (Jesse)":http://www.jessewarden.com/archives/2005/09/macromedia_flas.html, "Justin (Justin)":http://www.peterelst.com/blog/2005/09/29/flash-8-credits/, "Peter (Peter)":http://justin.everett-church.com/index.php/2005/09/29/flash-8-credits-no-thank-you/. Well, I then realized the pattern happening and I was thinking "Am I missing something?". So, I looked at the Credit Roll more closely and I saw my name, *Brajeshwar Oinam*, along with some of the best Flash Developers in the world. This is cool!</p>
<p>Most of my other Flash Friends are on the Credit List too;<br />
"Guy Watson (Guy Watson)":http://www.flashguru.co.uk/flash-8-special-thanks/<br />
"More listings at IFBIN (More listings at IFBIN)":http://www.ifbin.com/news/2005/09/14-ifbin-authors-receive-credit-within.html</p>
<p>*Do you really want to locate my name in the Flash Credit Roll?*<br />
In Flash 8 (or later versions), open up the *About Flash* dialog box from the *Help* menu. Look at the *Special Thanks - Our Families and Friends* section after *Technical Support and Beta Support* > *Corporate Honchos*.</p>
<p>*Thank You Macromedia*</p>
<p>__Note:__<br />
I will have to request them to correct my last name, it should be *Oinam* and not *Onem*. I should have checked the credit roll during the beta! Let me hope, it is corrected in Flash 9!<br />
Btw, I have never looked so closely at the Flash Credit Roll before!</p>
