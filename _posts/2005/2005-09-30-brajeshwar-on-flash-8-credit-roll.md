I saw the video of the Making of Flash 8 and I could see that I was nowhere to be seen in the scope. Ok, not a problem as I never knew they will use the footages for such a cool video.

But then, I saw

[Jesse Warden](http://www.jessewarden.com/archives/2005/09/macromedia_flas.html),
[Peter Elst](http://www.peterelst.com/blog/2005/09/29/flash-8-credits/),
[Justin Everett](http://justin.everett-church.com/index.php/2005/09/29/flash-8-credits-no-thank-you/),
[Guy Watson](http://www.flashguru.co.uk/flash-8-special-thanks/),
and [others](http://www.ifbin.com/news/2005/09/14-ifbin-authors-receive-credit-within.html).

Well, I then realized the pattern happening. So, I looked at the Credit Roll more closely and I saw my name, `Brajeshwar Oinam`, along with some of the best Flash Developers in the world. This is cool!

I will have to request them to correct my last name, it should be `Oinam` and not `Onem`. I should have checked the credit roll during the beta! Let me hope, it is corrected in Flash 9!
Btw, I have never looked so closely at the Flash Credit Roll before!
