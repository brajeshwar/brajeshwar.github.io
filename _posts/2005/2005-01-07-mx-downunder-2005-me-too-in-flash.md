<p>I was on a quick ICQ session with <a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/" title="Grant Skinner">Grant Skinner</a>:</p>
<p><em>Session Start (Grant Skinner): Sat Jan 08 00:07:49 2005<br />
Grant Skinner: you look like a bad comic book villain in your MXDU picture. :D<br />
Grant Skinner: http://www.mxdu.com/go/speakers/brajeshwar-oinam<br />
Grant Skinner: (not that I look that much better in mine)<br />
Brajeshwar: lol</em></p>
<p>MXDU 2005, besides the main event, something to really watch out for is the Hands On Workshops. This is a practical hands-on workshops presented by world-renowned industry specialists, to be held on 16 February 2005, Day Zero of the Conference.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Day Zero Agenda</p>
<p>* Get Ready for Blackstone!<br />
* Best Practices Pattern-Based AS 2 Dev<br />
* Enterprise Development for Flash MX 2004</p>
<p><em>Personally, this is going to be my first ever international appearance and I am filled with mixed feelings of excitement, restlessness, an eagerness to be there, a reluctance that it is so close. I am happy with not only the fact that I am speaking there but that I will be meeting some of the best known Flash Gurus whom I had been a fan ever since the early days of my Flashed life, interact with the best people in this industry. Just have a look at the speakers line up; I consider myself blessed that I would be meeting them all. Even meeting half of them would have been a "mission accomplished".</em></p>
