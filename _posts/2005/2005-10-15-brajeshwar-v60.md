<p>I have been planning a revamp for almost a year and when I finally did one, it looks like it needed a revamp tomorrow. But then, let me put that tomorrow for another year! I just saw "Joshuaink (Joshuaink)":http://joshuaink.com/blog/, that kept me pondering if that is a website or a nicely well-kept, mowed garden where beautiful flowers grow. The site is so nice, clean and wierdly beautiful that made my site look like a rectangular match-box with steel frames. Nothing more can I do than just be jealous and admire that site design.</p>
<p>Onwards, browsing through the galley section at "CSSVault (CSSVault)":http://cssvault.com/, I am totally amazed at how people come up with some of the best known UI Designs. Look at the cool UI Designs, "Spilt Cocoa (Spilt Cocoa)":http://chiseko.hosted.doosh.net/, "Folietto (Folietto)":http://www.folietto.at/, "JoshDura (JoshDura)":http://www.joshdura.com/, "Snook (Snook)":http://www.snook.ca/jonathan/, __etcetera__ and yes, I felt again that I should re-do my site!<br />
<br />
But then, with the current v6, I have learnt few more xhtml, css tricks and am trying my best to implement some if not all of them;</p>
<p>* "Stop quoting URLs (Stop quoting URLs)":http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#uri.<br />
* "0" do not need a unit unlike others because zero pixels equals zero centimeters equals zero of any other length unit. Despite this itÃ‡Æ’Ã™s very common to see something like @padding: 0px@ where @padding: 0@ would do.<br />
* Take advantage of inheritance and cascading nature of Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
<p>And, "IE Blog (IE Blog)":http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/ have also "Call to action, The demise of CSS hacks and broken pages (Call to action, The demise of CSS hacks and broken pages)":http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/12/480242.aspx. IE7 will fix many of the parsing bugs that CSS hacks rely on. Using "conditional comments (conditional comments)":http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp is the safest way of dealing with CSS bugs in Internet Explorer. Some of the CSS hacks that will very likely not work in Internet Explorer 7 are:</p>
<p>* html > body<br />
* * html<br />
* head:first-child + body<br />
* head + body<br />
* body > element</p>
<p>Finally, version 6.0 is under a real-time upgrade and you might encounter inconveniences! If you are looking for an article, the search facility provided is a good option to try your luck.</p>
<p>Btw, feel free to "download (download brajeshwar v6.0 template)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/downloads/com.brajeshwar/brajeshwarv6.zip the "Template ()":http://www.brajeshwar.com/versions/v6/ for Brajeshwar v6.0.</p>
