# Brajeshwar v6.0

I have been planning a revamp for almost a year and when I finally did one, it looks like it needed a revamp tomorrow. But then, let me put that tomorrow for another year! I just saw [Joshuaink](http://joshuaink.com/blog/), that kept me pondering if that is a website or a nicely well-kept, mowed garden where beautiful flowers grow. The site is so nice, clean and wierdly beautiful that made my site look like a rectangular match-box with steel frames. Nothing more can I do than just be jealous and admire that site design.

Onwards, browsing through the galley section at [CSSVault](http://cssvault.com/), I am totally amazed at how people come up with some of the best known UI Designs. Look at the cool UI Designs,
[Spilt Cocoa](http://chiseko.hosted.doosh.net/),
"Folietto (Folietto)":http://www.folietto.at/,
"JoshDura (JoshDura)":http://www.joshdura.com/,
"Snook (Snook)":http://www.snook.ca/jonathan/, etc.

But then, with the current v6, I have learnt few more xhtml, css tricks and am trying my best to implement some if not all of them;

- [Stop quoting URLs](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#uri).
- `0` do not need a unit unlike others because zero pixels equals zero centimeters equals zero of any other length unit. Despite this it's very common to see something like `padding: 0px` where `padding: 0` would do.
- Take advantage of inheritance and cascading nature of Cascading Style Sheets.

Finally, version 6.0 is under a real-time upgrade and you might encounter inconveniences! If you are looking for an article, the search facility provided is a good option to try your luck.
