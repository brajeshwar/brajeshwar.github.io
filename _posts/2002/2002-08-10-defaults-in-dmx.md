# Defaults in DMX

A list member from Blueworld's Dreamweaver list mailed me as to where has the default template for the new Pages that opens up in DMX gone. Well, the "default" template in the new DMX is is no longer on "...\configuration\templates". The new location of the default templates for DMX is now in "...\Macromedia\Dreamweaver MX\Configuration\DocumentTypes\NewDocuments". You will find a bunch of all templates for new documents, change whichever you want to suit yourself. The default for your html is "Default.html".
