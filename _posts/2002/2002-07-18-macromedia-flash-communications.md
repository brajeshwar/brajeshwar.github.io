# Macromedia Flash Communications

Macromedia have released the much awaited [Flash Communication Components](http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashcom/download/components/). This is going to keep me awake late tonight and hoping to see some of my visitors again and talk with them, make fun. See you again tonight. Damn, the released components are already in the trial and there is nothing new.
