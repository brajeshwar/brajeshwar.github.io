# TextPad syntax file for ASMX

[Textpad](http://www.textpad.com/) is my favorite Text Editor so far, and I use it as the external editor for ActionScript. I was happy to see Chak at the Macromedia Seminar here in Mumbai, India, using the same.

Update: I have removed the syntax file for ActionScript as it is no longer relevant. Please download the latest ActionSctipt syntax file from the [Syntax Definition](http://www.textpad.com/add-ons/syna2g.html).
