title: Be Bevelled / Connect Locally
---

Long ago Samuel Wan was talking about some component for the different kind of bevels and about 48 hours ago, he have it on his <a href="http://samuelwan.com/" title="samual wan">site</a> and you can download them, including the demo files and the component. Also, check his second post about his downloadable demo on local connection. You can view a similar example of the local connect, here which you can send and receive information both ways from either of the Flash documents.
