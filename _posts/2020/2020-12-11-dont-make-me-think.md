# Don’t Make Me Think

[Don’t Make Me Think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Make_Me_Think) by [Steve Krug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Krug) is about human–computer interaction and web usability. The idea is that a good software program or web site should let users accomplish their intended tasks as easily and directly as possible.

> “If something is usable — whether it’s a web site, a remote control, or a revolving door — it means that a person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it’s worth.”

The book is a foundational must-read in User Experience (UX) design. It remains essential reading for anyone creating user-friendly websites, apps, and digital interfaces. “Don’t make me think” embodies the idea that users should intuitively understand how to interact with a system without confusion.

The book advises that even a small amount of testing with real users is better than none. It encourages teams to embed user feedback into their workflows without overcomplicating the process.

The book emphasizes the value of leveraging conventions, allowing users to rely on familiar patterns rather than requiring them to learn something entirely new. By reducing friction, conventions free users to focus on their goals instead of figuring out the interface.

It also stresses the importance of a clear visual hierarchy to guide users’ attention, providing practical tips like effectively using size, contrast, and placement.

One of the most interesting suggestions is to reduce and simplify text. In a world where users often skim rather than read, the emphasis on brevity and clarity feels even more relevant today.

Remember;

- We don’t read pages. We scan them.
- We don’t make optimal choices. We “satisfice”.
- We don’t figure out how things work. We muddle through.

The book’s core principles remain timeless despite the rapid evolution of UX tools and trends. Its focus on human behavior, user-centric thinking, and simplicity has universal application. While digital environments have grown more complex, the fundamentals—reducing friction, prioritizing clarity, and testing with real users—are as applicable now as they were when the book first debuted.
