# V for Vendetta

[V for Vendetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_(film)) is a movie worth re-watching. I have re-watched it so many times that I have lost count. The film reimagines the book [1984](/2024/1984/) with Elrond of Rivendell[^Elrond] in an alternate universe as a rebellion.

A dystopian political action film, it is based on the [1988–89 DC Vertigo Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta) limited series of the same title by Alan Moore, David Lloyd, and Tony Weare. The film, set in a future where a fascist totalitarian regime has subjugated the UK, centers on V, an anarchist and masked freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, and on Evey Hammond, a young woman caught up in V’s mission.

The film is set in future Britain, ruled by the Norsefire political party, a fascist and totalitarian regime led by High Chancellor Adam Sutler, which controls the populace through propaganda and imprisons or executes those deemed undesirable, including immigrants, homosexuals and people of alternative religions.

One man stood up, V, who moves through London like a wraith despite the desperate efforts of the police. He wears a mask showing the face of Guy Fawkes[^GuyFawkes], who in 1605, tried to blow up the houses of Parliament. On November 5th, the eve of Guy Fawkes Day, British schoolchildren have started bonfires to burn Fawkes in effigy for centuries. On this eve, V saves a young TV reporter named Evey from the hands of the police, forces her to join him, and makes a busy night of it by blowing up the Old Bailey courtrooms.

V follows his exploits for the year until the night when he has vowed to strike a crushing blow against the dictatorship. We see a police state that holds citizens in an iron grip. V commandeers the national television network to claim authorship of his deed.

[^Elrond]: In the Lord of the Rings, Elrond, Lord of Rivendell, (played by Hugo Weaving) was a mighty Elf-ruler of old who dwelt in Middle-earth from the First Age to the beginning of the Fourth Age. He was the father of Elladan and Elrohir and Arwen Undómiel, the eventual wife of Aragorn II Elessar.

[^GuyFawkes]: [Guy Fawkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes) (Apr 13, 1570 – Jan 31, 1606) was a member of a group of provincial English Catholics involved in the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605.
