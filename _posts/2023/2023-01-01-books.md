___Work-in-Progress.__ This year, intead of writing a list of books at the end of year, I've decided to list the books that I'm likely to read, re-read, or have earmarked for reading. I will update the article as and when I read the books and can write something about them._

[How to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-to-Be-Perfect/Michael-Schur/9781982159313) by [Michael Schur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schur) is a fun book that opens with a good question, "Should I punch my friend in the face for no reason?" Yes, it also has the Trolley Problem[^trolley-problem]. A starter book on how to lead an ethical life. The books simplifies the ideas of virtue ethics[^virtue-ethics], deontology[^deontology], utalitarianism[^utalitarianism], contractualism[^contractualism], ubuntu[^ubuntu], and existentialism[^existentialism], making it easy for the readers. Of course, the idea of "moral perfection" is both impossible to attain, and a bad idea to even attempt. Observe, learn, have the mindset to be better, embracing our inevitable failures while still trying to be an all-around better person.

And NO! Don’t punch your friend. Go be a good person.

Every year, I try to re-read one or more of the [best books](/books/) I have ever read. I have a [wishlist of books](https://www.amazon.in/hz/wishlist/ls/26U9UE2WQ2WTI) yet to be bought and read.

[//]: # Footnote

[^trolley-problem]: The [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) is a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number. The series usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas are posed, each containing the option to either do nothing, in which case several people will be killed, or intervene and sacrifice one initially "safe" person to save the others.
[^virtue-ethics]: [Virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics) is an approach to ethics that treats the concept of moral virtue as central. Virtue ethics is usually contrasted with two other major approaches in ethics -- consequentialism and deontology -- which make the goodness of outcomes of an action (consequentialism) and the concept of moral duty (deontology) central.
[^deontology]: [Deontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology) is the normative ethical theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules and principles, rather than based on the consequences of the action.
[^utalitarianism]: [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a family of normative ethical theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being for all affected individuals.
[^contractualism]: [Contractualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractualism) refers either to a family of political theories in the social contract tradition (when used in this sense, the term is an umbrella term for all social contract theories that include contractarianism).
[^ubuntu]: [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) is a Nguni Bantu term meaning "humanity". It is sometimes translated as "I am because we are" (also "I am because you are"), or "humanity towards others" (Zulu umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu). In Xhosa, the latter term is used, but is often meant in a more philosophical sense to mean "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".
[^existentialism]: [Existentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism) explores the problem of human existence and centers on human thinking, feeling, and acting. Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence, and the role of personal agency in transforming one's life. In the view of an existentialist, the individual's starting point is phenomenological, grounded in the immediate direct experience of life.
