title: It was an evening of laughter at the Black Dog Comedy Evenings - Uncensored
  And Unleashed
---

Recently, I was invited to attend an event - a Standup Comedy. Well, it was a surprising invitation. I had been invited to lots of events, but there were either technical, blog-related, startups, entrepreneurship and alike, but a Standup Comedy Event! I'm sure the other 'bloggers' were equally surprised.

I realized they want to highlight the event and the sponsoring brands to bloggers, but they were not really after us to write about them nor were they specific about what type of articles were written.

Despite all of that, the evening turned out to be a super awesome one for me. I laughed and laughed so much that my stomach hurts for the next two days. However, I've to be honest and confess that I'm still new to Bangalore and could not grasp all of the South-Indian specific jokes and punch-lines. <a href="http://www.istahotels.com/">Ista Hotel</a> hosted the Black Dog Comedy Evenings "Uncensored And Unleashed".

Of course, let me warn you that if you follow the likes of <a href="http://azizansari.com/<br />
">Aziz Ansari</a>, <a href="http://www.russellpeters.com/">Russell Peters</a>, you'll find them trying hard to be like Russell, Aziz. Nonetheless, I enjoyed them thoroughly. Just leave the expectations at the bar or the door and have an easy evening.
