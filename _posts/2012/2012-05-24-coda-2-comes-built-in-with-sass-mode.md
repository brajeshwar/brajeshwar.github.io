# Coda 2 comes built-in with Sass Mode
Sometime back in Nov 2011, I was contacted by <a href="http://stevenf.com/">Steven Frank</a>, Co-Founder of [Panic](https://panic.com/). Panic wanted to officially support Sass with their upcoming new version of Coda, and wanted to start off from our <a href="https://github.com/brajeshwar/Sass.mode">Sass.Mode</a> (maintained by me and <a href="http://www.tommariusolsen.com/">Tom-Marius Olsen</a>).

Well, why not. That was an awesome thing. Today, Panic released <a href="http://panic.com/coda/">Coda 2</a>, complete with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> Mode built-in.
