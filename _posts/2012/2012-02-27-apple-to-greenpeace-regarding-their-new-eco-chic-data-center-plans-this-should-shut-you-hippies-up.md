title: Apple to Greenpeace regarding their New Eco-Chic Data Center Plans, "this should
  shut you hippies up"
---

In response to on-going environmental group pressure Apple has decided to go Green. Making it a Green Apple. After years of persecution from groups like Greenpeace (an irony in itself given that many of Greenpeace's dread-lock-sporting, bored-surbubanite-desperately-looking-for-a-cause Macbook owners) Apple is finally bending to group will and greening one of its largest facilities. 

Apple's data center in Maiden, NC is getting an eco-chic makeover with the largest set of end user-owned, on-site solar arrays in the country. This is in addition to its previous white cool-roof and LEED Platinum certificate from the U.S. Green Building Council, a level unparalleled by any other comparably-sized data center in the U.S notes Apple. The solar-reflective roof deflects much of the facilities cooling needs, a factor reduced again by their chilled-water storage system that allows for the offset of 10,400 kWh of electricity consumption to be transferred from peak to off-peak hours. 

In addition to the solar array Apple also has plans in the works for a 20-megawatt renewable energy facility on the 100 acres surrounding the data center. On a personal note, I personally love this 'that'll-shut-em-up' plan. The surrounding renewable energy facility will produce 42million kWh annually.

Perhaps Greenpeace still has their <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/04/22/greenpeace-apples-power-dirty-dangerous/">panties in a wad</a> though because Apple still hasn't announced the supposed date that these new green changes will come online. 

Greenpeace, and other enviro-groups re-focused Apple in their cross hairs after Apple's recently-released <a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/reports/docs/Apple_Facilities_Report_2012.pdf">report</a> detailing their commitment to environmental excellence. The report detailed the environmental impact of Apple's worldwide facilities, and included its retail stores, R&D facilities and operations and data centers. The included figures however are a mere ripple compared to the production, transport, use and recycling (or lack thereof) of its products says enviro groups. 

One has to wonder though, can you blame a brand for following consumer demand for the production, transport, use and recycling of its products that are sold around the globe in tens of thousands of locations worldwide.
