title: Interesting, strange, weird way to save our forests
---

Greenpeace India has released an interesting <a href="http://foresthero.org?source=blo">Facebook App</a> where you can add a picture to a video, portraying you as a 'hero' saving the forests in Central India from coal mining.

The whole idea looks interesting and you should try it out. Unfortunately, for me, I'm a little confused as none of the menus seem to work. They seem to be just message links. I wasn't really able to take up the "Challenging Goal" neither could I "Make a Difference". Let's hope there is more to it than meets the eye.

Of course, the site reeks of 'innovative technology' such as keyframe manipulation and color correction in the Flash Player to embed a static object (picture/image) alongside the video and they have even thrown in a parallax scrolling web design.

Coal mining in Central Indian forests is destroying the habitat of the endangered tiger, other wildlife and displacing lakhs of forests dwellers. Greenpeace urges individuals from all across the country to join the movement to save our last remaining forests, tigers and livelihoods of forest dependent communities.

Personally, I'd like to do something but I'm not really sure all that jazz on the website is the solution! What do you think?

Nonetheless, <a href="http://foresthero.org?source=blo">play with the app</a>, enjoy the video, watch the parallax scrolling - it should entertain you.
