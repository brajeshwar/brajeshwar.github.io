<a href="http://www.in50hrs.com/">In50hrs</a> is an interesting concept, where ideas meet doer to build something in a short time - a weekend.

> In50hrs is The Idea-To-Prototype Event. Entrepreneurs (or Idea Smiths), Developers and Product Designers come together to work on audacious ideas and build working prototypes (MVP) over a Weekend.

In50hrs have few chapters happening across major Indian cities -

I registered for the Bangalore Chapter. I have a few ideas and I'll also be doing the design part - HTML, CSS, Graphics. I can also write codes and be part of the development and help design the product in direct coordination with a developer.

If you're a developer or a student who have good programming skill and have registered for In50hrs, Bangalore, I'd welcome you to contact me to see how we can work together.
