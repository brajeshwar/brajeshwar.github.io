<p>In50hrs have few chapters happening across major Indian cities -</p>
<p>* Bangalore: Nov 23-25, 2012<br />
* Pune: Dec 14-16, 2012<br />
* Chennai: Jan 11-13, 2013</p>
<p>I registered for the Bangalore Chapter. I have a few ideas and I'll also be doing the design part - HTML, CSS, Graphics. I can also write codes and be part of the development and help design the product in direct coordination with a developer.</p>
<p>If you're a developer or a student who have good programming skill and have registered for In50hrs, Bangalore, I'd welcome you to contact me to see how we can work together.</p>
