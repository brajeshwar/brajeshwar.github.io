<p>An interesting development in Bollywood - use of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nissanindia">Facebook</a> to approach the common public and involved them in movie making.</p>
<p>Nissan created the 'New Star of India', a Bollywood movie auditioned on Facebook. It seems, quite a lot of people auditioned for an opportunity to act alongside the Bollywood actor Ranbir Kapoor. From well over 2500 hopefuls, 20 were chosen to be in the movie.</p>

<p>From the videos, the movie seem to be disproportionately sponsored by Nissan to promote their car - Nissan Micra. The movie is being released pretty soon everywhere in India.</p>
<p>Indeed, an interesting approach to involve and spread awareness of movies harnessing the power of social media and the ever-growing users in India.</p>
<p>Of course, the promoters have agreed to get Movie merchandise and T-Shirts for you guys. So, show hands and comment your thoughts.</p>
