<p>Google Chrome is one of the most suave and user friendly browsers. This browser is mostly used as a style statement due to its vogue user interface and themes. The good news for Chrome lovers and Android owners is that google has started offering the beta version of the <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2012/02/introducing-chrome-for-android.html">chrome browser for the android users</a>. On the flip side, the chrome browser is only available for the android devices that use Android version 4.0 or popularly known as the Ice Cream Sandwich. Currently only 1% of the Android population are on <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.android.chrome">Ice Cream Sandwich Android devices</a>.</p>

<p>Similar to tabs the auto complete is also compatible across various devices. If you have entered some of your details through chrome in your P.C with auto complete on then you can be able to view the auto complete details on your Android tablet. This is again very useful when you want to fill forms quickly.</p>
<h3>Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Of course, now you can open the bookmarks you stored on chrome from your P.C through your android 4.0 tablet. Isn't it cool? No more menace of searching your P.Cs bookmarks and then type it on your tablet.</p>
