<p>There's been quite an array of reactions to the new move by Y Combinator when they announced the application for startup entrepreneurs <a href="http://ycombinator.com/noidea.html">sans the idea</a> of a Business or a Product. As a 'Startup Entrepreneur', my spontaneous reaction, wrapped in <a href="http://twitter.com/Brajeshwar/status/179801822804967424">a tweet</a> was, "any entrepreneur or founder eager to do a Startup will be brimming with ideas."</p>
<p>Oh! Yes, I don't hesitate calling myself a Startup Entrepreneur these days as I've failed quite a few times to have experienced and know a thing or two about Startups and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>However, on a second look at YC's initiative, I realized this is a brilliant gambit - YC is ready to take a much bigger albeit calculated risk for a long term winning move. Here's why.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley is already pack with people who can do much more than most normal people would even dare to dream. I can equate this to being the 'Supermen' in one of Monty Python's popular Bicycle Repairman. Eventually, it's really hard to find a Bicycle Repairman in Silicon Valley - you'll find more of Supermen than the ones that would do the grit of the work for someone else. (Watch Monty Python's Bicycle Repairman video below.)</p>
<p>Now, add to that, the recent Facebook IPO and the breed of millionaire developers and designers that have mushroomed. In fact, the moment you enter 'the bar' to fetch nuts from the big black bear's cage, you might have brushed with more millionaires than you'll ever imagined.</p>
<p>Well, what am I implying -- it is very very hard to hire good talents in Silicon Valley, leave alone trying to find a co-founder for your paradigm shifting, patent-pending idea. YC's new move can indeed be a real recruiting manna for YC Startup fraternity -- the ultimate to a near-perfect co-founder dating.</p>
<p>The hackers, the <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/2011/desingineer-the-mythical-person-every-startups-are-looking-for/">Desingineer</a> with no business or product ideas, selected by YC are indeed the perfect ones who can be founding members of the YC Startups. It's a win-win for everyone involved. <em>Choose a YC Startup or bid for the YC screened talents.</em> Brilliant!</p>

<p><em>Addendum</em></p>
<p>My time in Silicon Valley was only for a couple of months when I started my real-time Mobile Video Dating Startup - Levoma. So, it's perfectly OK if you find my assessment rather vague at best. Actually, an experienced VC once told me, "In the valley, it's considered un-cool if you read it through Techcrunch, Valleywag and other blogs." I admit, I'm in that un-cool lot.</p>
