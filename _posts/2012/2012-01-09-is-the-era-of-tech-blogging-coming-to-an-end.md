# Is the era of Tech Blogging coming to an end?

Statistical trends show that the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/12/rip-the-golden-age-of-tech-blo.php">golden age of tech blogging</a> has come to an end. This is almost the end of an era, as the tech blogosphere is over. According to famous tech bloggers analysts, there are some valid <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2011/12/27/end-of-an-era-the-golden-age-of-tech-blogging-is-over/">reasons for this change</a> and for the extinction of tech blogging.

Here are few reasons that may be the contributor for the beginning of the end.

- For the last years, there has been much of acquisition of organized blogs (very much similar to news sites) particularly, Techcrunch, which supposedly claimed 10 million per year as annual revenue, was acquired by AOL. These are quite common purchases; as in 2005 AOL had purchased Engadget and Huffington Post in 2011. Many other tech blogs have also being purchased in between. These acquisitions have pressured out the star talent or the team of founders and the corporate teams rise to glory. These acquisitions have also led to the decrease of innovation.
- The tech blogosphere is witnessing great loss of talents. After the acquisition has happened, many tech blogs such as Read Write Web, Techcrunch and others, have experienced resignation of staff on a large scale. These exits have caused further erosion of tech blogging and many talents have deviated to other business models.
- The tastes, preferences and demands of the audiences have changed to a large extent. The internet market is now crowded with so many blogs, web-pages and sites, that it is impossible for people to go through all of them. In this fast paced world, readers prefer short, crisp content, very much in the manner of social media sites; which involve sharing and commenting. Posts in Facebook, Twitter and Google plus get better response than posts in blogs and web pages. This shows the impatience of readers to read longer articles. Thus, the change of content strategy has also led to the decline of tech blogging.
- It is really a big challenge for bloggers to sustain their blogging activities. It has been a common trend in the market that business models keep on changing from time to time. In this ever evolving business market and acquisition, it is necessary for bloggers to maintain their task of blogging. However, their drifting apart to other spheres with the change of business trends has eroded that tech blogosphere to such an extent, that it has almost come to an end. 

Nonetheless, there is another school of thought that <a href="http://www.markevanstech.com/2011/12/28/the-golden-age-of-tech-blogging/">refuses to accept the view</a> that tech blogging have come to an end. They rest their arguments on the fact that technology is never constant; tech blogs emerge and fall, bloggers become stars and then pale into insignificance. This school of thought believes that actual bloggers do not blog for money; so company acquisition should not be a big issue for them. They are hopeful that this apparent downfall of tech blogging will lead to the rise of another age of tech blogging which they anticipate as the 'golden age'. 

Thus, resting our views on the arguments and counter arguments, we can come to a conclusion that there is still chance of revival of tech blogging, provided the bloggers change their strategies and techniques.
