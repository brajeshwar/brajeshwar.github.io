# We wish Jennifer Lopez would return our calls

I have seen this long back but then when I saw it again today, I smiled at those punchy words, see it for yourself at Jeffrey Zeldman's [contact](http://zeldman.com/contact/) page. And if you are developing, learning, working on CSS, then his site should definitely be in your favorites bookmark.

Here is what he writes,

> We get more mail than Santa Claus. We appreciate it, but can't always keep up with it.
> 
> Santa has elves. We don't. We try to read every note. We wish we could respond to them all. We wish Jennifer Lopez would return our calls. You can't always get what you want.
