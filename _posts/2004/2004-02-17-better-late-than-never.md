title: Better late than never
---

Well, an address misplacement was infact the culprit for the late arrival of my Central gift from MM. But then the cleaner of my erstwhile office was too kind enough to dig up my goods that arrived some time ago and bring it to my home. From all the post all over, it is now well known that it includes a T-shirt (which is absent from the Clipping), besides 2 Macromedia Central Reference Posters, Central 32 MB Flash Memory stick, Central Whitepaper, Article/tutorial on getting started with Central and a Macromedia Central Button.
