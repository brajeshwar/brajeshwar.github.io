<p>Yes, it indeed started like any other night for Max (Jamie Foxx, remember his somewhat-similar situation in the <a href="http://baitmovie.warnerbros.com/" title="Bait, the Movie">Bait</a>, his passengers, his 12 times-holidays-in-a-day dream, the tropical island and a limo service. That faithful night, he had both a victim played by Jada Pinkett Smith (Niobe, of the Matrix Revolution) and the cold assassin, Vincent (Cruise), as his passenger. I really like the music, the background audio-beat of the movie; just as I like the music of <a href="http://www.italianjobmovie.com/" title="The Italian Job">The Italian Job</a>.</p>
<p>The story began to take shape when Vincent got into Max's cab at the airport. He then coaxed him to drive him around LA for the night with about 5 stop-overs with almost double his normal earning. Vincent was on a contract cleansing spree of 5 witnesses to a particular Federal trial. He has to finish them that faithful night as they are appearing in court the next day.</p>
<p>Cool, professional gun shots from Vincent, and the changing, developing facet of Foxx, starting from a dreamer to a fighter; the movie is a cool one for any fan of thriller, drama and of course Tom Cruise.</p>
