excerpt: One of the very noticeable glitch was whenever Garfield came in close interaction
  with other actors in the movie.  It looks like he is inside a big liquid glass cage
  where interaction happen within that thin film and do not really touch Garfield
  at all. It as seen very clear that there was a big gap between Garfield and the
  actors touching him.

<p><img src="/static/2004/11/garfieldthemovie.jpg" alt="Garfield the Movie" />Garfield The Movie, a good movie to laugh off and shake off the busy weekdays into a lazy weekend. I am sure it was not targeted just for kids. Being an ardent fan of that lazy cat, I like it as much as the parental guided bevies of kids around me. In fact, my first glance at the morning newspaper is that of Garfield's daily cartoon.</p>
