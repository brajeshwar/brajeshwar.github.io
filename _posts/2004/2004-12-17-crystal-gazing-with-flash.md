title: Crystal gazing with Flash

Nice use of Flash Video, [Ask Crystal](http://www.ask-crystal.com/); ask something and get it answered. You can repeat the same question and still get different answers. The application is intelligently executed with load queue management of the swf videos.

Looking at the "Most asked questions", I am sure girls use this a lot more than boys.

- Should I end my relationship?
- Can you help me?
- Am I too fat?
- How can I find a partner?
- Am I normal?
- Do you know Oprah?
- Can I change my boyfriend?
