title: Skype 1.0

[Skype](http://www.skype.com/) have released its latest version; unfortunately, all my contacts are gone. I am not sure if this was an expected happening with the release or if it was saving the contacts on the local drive like ICQ in the old times. I am sorry to say but I have none of the previous contacts in my list; please add me instead.
