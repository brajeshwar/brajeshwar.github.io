So there are coupla Flash Developers and Internet Application Developers who shares similar taste of books with me. One challenge thrown to me was by one of my good friend, to break the code at the end of "Digital Fortress".

I swear I never saw that before (I must have been too tired finishing the book in a day). `128-10-93-85-10-128-98-112-6-6-25-126-39-1-68-78`.

So, here it is, break this simple code, follows similar coding pattern as Dan Brown's

`19,15,20,12,12,16,13,19,2,5,1,13,23,5,20,13,5,9,4,5,3,14,12,5,4`
