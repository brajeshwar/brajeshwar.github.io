excerpt: Well, the whole movie then tries to relate Bourne to his first assignment,
  assassination of a Russian politician named Neski. He changed his plan and make
  it look like the wife killed the man and later herself though Bourne was supposed
  to just kill Neski. At the end, he explained that to the little kid, now fully grown
  Neski.

<p><a href="http://thebournesupremacy.com/"><img src="/static/2004/09/bournesupremacy.jpg" alt="The Bourne Supremacy" /></a>The Bourne Supremacy was released today, Friday, September 10, 2004, across theatres in India and I had to catch it first day, first show. Well, as always with movie series, the Bourne series too suffer from a similar syndrome "the first was better".</p>
<p>Matt Damon (Jason Bourne), the main character, suffers from Amnesia; he is an erstwhile assassin for a dissolved group within the CIA known as Treadstone. Bourne in on the run with Marie (Franka Potente), but is somehow compelled to come back and check out the twist and turns of the underbelly of the Espionage world again. The first take start off was in a hotel room in Goa, India and he spent quite a good amount of time in India. If I can remember well, there were atleast about 4 scenes of Goa, India. One of the assassination attempt took place in a village in Goa when he was attacked by a dreaded assassin (Karl Urban). Of course, as the race begins, Bourne took the audience from Goa to Berlin to Langley to Naples to London to Amsterdam to Moscow and finally to New York City, New York.<br />

Well, the whole movie then tries to relate Bourne to his first assignment, assassination of a Russian politician named Neski. He changed his plan and make it look like the wife killed the man and later herself though Bourne was supposed to just kill Neski. At the end, he explained that to the little kid, now fully grown Neski. Then there was Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), I could remember her as the mother/wife character in <strong>Face-Off</strong>, the Nicholas Cage - John Travolta thriller. One of the exclamatory scene was that of the climax which was the car chase through Moscow streets. It even sent one of the guy at my back to scream "f**k" at the end of the chase. He was almost getting up from his seat; there was a huge applaused laughter later on. On an overall, to me the movie was an engaging thriller.</p>
<p>The first part was "<a href="http://thebourneidentity.com/" title="The Bourne Identity">The Bourne Identity</a>" and if it is going the Robert Ludlum way, then the next should be "The Bourne Ultimatum". Oh! Did I forgot to tell you that the best part of watching that movie was that there were a group of three beautiful girls sitting besides me. I ended up explaining the story bits and pieces here and there as we races along with Bourne trying to find out what connects him to all the happenings; who, what was he? "Your name is David Webb", Landy told Bourne at the end!</p>
<p><span class="codeNull">I am reading Rober Ludlum's The Bourne Supremacy, the Novel. Will be writing something about the same later on.</span></p>
