I am really beginning to like the idea of the theaters, cinema houses, multi-plexes and even the Dome, in Mumbai, India in their way of making its cinegoers, citizen remember the National Anthem and be loyal to the country every time they are about to watch a movie.

I am not sure of the other parts of India. As far as I can recollect neither Delhi nor Bangalore do anything similar. Today, I went for the movie "Spy Kid's Game Over" and once again I "stood up" along with everybody to the National Anthem being sung at the AdLab just like what had been happening since a long time I could remember.

When else do you listen and pay respect to the National Anthem beside Independence Day, other National Days?

Indian National Anthem Lyric;

```
Jana-gana-mana-adhinayaka, jaya he
Bharata-bhagya-vidhata
Punjab-Sindhu-Gujarata-Maratha-
Dravida-Utkala-Banga
Vindhya-Himachala-Yamuna-Ganga
Uchchala-Jaladhi-taranga
Tava shubha name jage
Tava shubha ashish maange
Gahe tava jaya-gatha
Jana-gana-mangala-dayaka jaya he
Bharata-bhagya-vidhata
Jaya he, jaya he, jaya he
Jaya jaya jaya, jaya he!
```

The playing time of the National Anthem is approximately 52 seconds. The following is Tagore's own English rendering of the stanza;

```
Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people,
Dispenser of India's destiny.
Thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab, Sindhu,
Gujarat and Maratha,
Of the Dravida and Orissa and Bengal;
It echoes in the hills of the Vindhyas and Himalayas,
mingles in the music of Jamuna and Ganges and is
chanted by the waves of the Indian Sea.
They pray for thy blessings and sing thy praise.
The saving of all people waits in thy hand,
Thou dispenser of India's destiny.
Victory, victory, victory to thee.
