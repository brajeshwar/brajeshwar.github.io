title: Macromedia Goodies Season, again
---

The Fedex guy knocked at my door again and gave me that big box seen in the image. One of the cool content that I really adore is the pair of boxes containing "Flash MX 2004 Component Collectible Cards". The main attraction was neverthless, the Flash Timbuk2 Laptop Messenger Bag and the Flash T-Shirt (gotoAndPlay). There was also the article discussing the recent update to Flash (Ellipsis), changes to the Flash team and how Macromedia sees Flash evolving in the future, a booklet on "Web Video with Macromedia Flash".

The kit contains the following major components:

- new extension to Dreamweaver for deploying Flash video
- lite version of the new Sorenson Squeeze 4.0
- 15-day trial of the new Flash Video Streaming Service Lite, powered by Vitalstream
- comprehensive video primer that details all you need to know about Flash video
