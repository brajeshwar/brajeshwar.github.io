# Naked Text-Imaging truth

When e-mail clients started blocking images, the spammers have already gone ahead and are finding ways around the same. I had been damn too happy that with the introduction of Service Pack 2 on my Windows XP box, I won't be freaking out seeing unduly illicite images while opening my mail client in front of friend, clients, family members and relatives.

But, that was short lived when I received one particular innovative way among the usual spam bunch. Well, I think I have to appreciate them for their supremacy in the under-ground stuffs. I was skeptical of having this on my site but then I think, it won't harm much having it archived. They have already done it, so I may be way behind anyway.
