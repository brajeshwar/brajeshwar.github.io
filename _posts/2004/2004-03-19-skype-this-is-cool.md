# Skype, this is cool

I have always refrained myself from using 'Voice Chats' on most applications because the connection here is not all that good at most of the time. But today when Joey Lott introduced me to this cool product, [Skype](http://www.skype.com/), I became an ultimate fan of the same. The audio was clear and my speech was getting through very smoothly. I am planning to try this on a dial-up (waiting for someone to talk to now).

It is free. Now I think I won't have to worry about strained hands typing Instant Messages with clients for project discussion, this will also save them time and can explain things better to me, fast and quick.
