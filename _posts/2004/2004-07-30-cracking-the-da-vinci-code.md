# Cracking the Da Vinci Code

Read [The Da Vinci Code](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code) by [Dan Brown](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown) and I like it.

Well, I am not that in a position to give any remarks about the books, many have done many reviews, feedbacks and everything else. I just like the Da Vinci Code Book, finished reading it in two days. Well after reading the main book, I ended up loving the works of Dan Brown that I went and bought myself, "Digital Fortress", and finished reading it in a day's time.
