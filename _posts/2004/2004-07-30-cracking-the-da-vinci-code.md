# Cracking the Da Vinci Code

After reading [Dan Brown](http://www.danbrown.com/)'s The Da Vinci Code, [Cracking the Da Vinci Code](www.crackingdavinci.com/) was the next book that caught my eye and yes I bought it, read it and I like it.

Well, I am not that in a position to give any remarks about the books, many have done many reviews, feedbacks and everything else. I just like the Da Vinci Code Book, finished reading it in two days. Well after reading the main book, I ended up loving the works of Dan Brown that I went and bought myself, "Digital Fortress", and finished reading it in a day's time.
