<p>"Millions use our software. A chosen few develop it." That is the head tagline that I saw on the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/india/" title="Macromdia India">Macromedia India</a> website. I had remained totally silent about the Macromedia Development center at Bangalore, India because none at Macromedia mentioned that officially. But now I think everything is official and open. If you are looking for job opportunities, head over the site and apply for the same. </p>

<p>I remember that phone call (an excerpt);</p>
<p><em>Lady</em>: Do you want to work for a company which is your dream company?<br />
<em>Me</em>: May I know the name of the Company?</p>
<p><em>Lady</em>: I am sorry, but it is a big MNC and is your dream company!<br />
<em>Me</em>: Well, you have to give me an extremely good reason, I rejected IBM's offer recently. Are you from the same Recruiting Agency?</p>
<p><em>Lady</em>: No.<br />
<em>Me</em>: How did you get my number?</p>
<p><em>Lady</em>: We have databases of developers, and I also registered recently at <a href="http://indiammug.com/" title="IndiaMMUG">IndiaMMUG</a> and I saw your name there too.<br />
<em>Me</em>: Ok</p>
<p><em>Lady</em>: The company have setup a new office in Bangalore and they are looking for talented developers, many have applied.<br />
<em>Me</em>: (with the recent buzz about Macromedia, India, I was feeling the air of the same) Is this about Macromedia?</p>
<p><em>Lady</em>: YES<br />
<em>Me</em>: Had it been 2 years ago, I would have jump in right away. I am flattered but I am sorry.</p>
