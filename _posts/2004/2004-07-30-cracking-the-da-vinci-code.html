excerpt: Well, I am not that in a position to give any remarks about the books, many
  have done many reviews, feedbacks and everything else. I just like the Da Vinci
  Code Book, finished reading it in two days. Well after reading the main book, I
  ended up loving the works of Dan Brown that I went and bought myself, "Digital Fortress",
  and finished reading it in a day's time.
