# The GHOST

Thanks to everybody who have asked for me, I am fine. I was sleeping in a hotel room somewhere in Bangalore, India when the Tsunami struck many South Asian region including India.

A day earlier, I went to the Macromedia Office, Bangalore</a> (INDIA) and met some friends. I met the GHOST but could not get authenticated. By the way, I learnt that Bangalore has abundant wi-fi hotspots unlike Mumbai.

Wishing you all a Happy New Year!
