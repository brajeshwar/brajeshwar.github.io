excerpt: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is associated by symptoms and signs, which are caused
  by compression of the median nerve travelling through the carpal tunnel. Carpal
  Tunnel Syndrome affects the hands since it is an upper limb neuropathy that results
  in motor and sensory disturbance of the median nerve.

<p>The pain seems to come and go, sometimes it lingers through the night. Massaging the back of the palm and the fingers with pain-relieve ointments helps a bit but it is there. The fear of course is of the <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/health_and_medical/pubs/carpal_tunnel.htm" title="Carpal Tunnel Syndrome">Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</a>. My fear was aggravated when I discovered that another of my friend was diagnosed with similar symptoms, and his doctor warned him of a very early stage of CTS.</p>
<p>We laugh off at "no typing for 2 months" advise from the doctor; but then things have to be done to counter the same. Well, I have decided to go and buy some of the best ergonomic keyboard, searching yield me to FingerWorks' TouchStream Keyboards. Here the problem is that the keyboard cost about $339 and the import duty to India will double its cost (that total cost will likely be the typical cost of a Pentium IV Desktop).</p>
<p>Anybody have suggestions for some good keyboards, please comment or let me know through the contact form. Also suggestions and advise about CTS are welcome too.</p>
<h3>More about Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (in brief)</h3>

<h3>What is carpal tunnel syndrome?</h3>
<p>Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the hand, becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist. The median nerve controls sensations to the palm side of the thumb and fingers (although not the little finger), as well as impulses to some small muscles in the hand that allow the fingers and thumb to move. The carpal tunnel - a narrow, rigid passageway of ligament and bones at the base of the hand houses the median nerve and tendons. Sometimes, thickening from irritated tendons or other swelling narrows the tunnel and causes the median nerve to be compressed.</p>
<p>The result may be pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm. Although painful sensations may indicate other conditions, carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common and widely known of the entrapment neuropathies in which the body's peripheral nerves are compressed or traumatized.</p>
<h3>What are the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome?</h3>
<p>Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or itching numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the thumb and the index and middle fingers. Some carpal tunnel sufferers say their fingers feel useless and swollen, even though little or no swelling is apparent. The symptoms often first appear in one or both hands during the night, since many people sleep with flexed wrists. A person with carpal tunnel syndrome may wake up feeling the need to "shake out" the hand or wrist. As symptoms worsen, people might feel tingling during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. In chronic and/or untreated cases, the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. Some people are unable to tell between hot and cold by touch.</p>
<h3>What are the causes of carpal tunnel syndrome?</h3>
<p>Carpal tunnel syndrome is often the result of a combination of factors that increase pressure on the median nerve and tendons in the carpal tunnel, rather than a problem with the nerve itself. Most likely the disorder is due to a congenital predisposition - the carpal tunnel is simply smaller in some people than in others. Other contributing factors include trauma or injury to the wrist that cause swelling, such as sprain or fracture; overactivity of the pituitary gland; hypothyroidism; rheumatoid arthritis; mechanical problems in the wrist joint; work stress; repeated use of vibrating hand tools; fluid retention during pregnancy or menopause; or the development of a cyst or tumor in the canal. In some cases no cause can be identified.</p>
<p>There is little clinical data to prove whether repetitive and forceful movements of the hand and wrist during work or leisure activities can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Repeated motions performed in the course of normal work or other daily activities can result in repetitive motion disorders such as bursitis and tendonitis. Writer's cramp - a condition in which a lack of fine motor skill coordination and ache and pressure in the fingers, wrist, or forearm is brought on by repetitive activity - is not a symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
<h3>How can carpal tunnel syndrome be prevented?</h3>
<p>At the workplace, workers can do on-the-job conditioning, perform stretching exercises, take frequent rest breaks, wear splints to keep wrists straight, and use correct posture and wrist position. Wearing fingerless gloves can help keep hands warm and flexible. Workstations, tools and tool handles, and tasks can be redesigned to enable the worker's wrist to maintain a natural position during work. Jobs can be rotated among workers. Employers can develop programs in ergonomics, the process of adapting workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of workers. However, research has not conclusively shown that these workplace changes prevent the occurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
