<p>It seems Macromedia ain't tired of gifting us. On this fateful day of the Diwali (Indian Festival of Light), I got another boxful of gift from Edward Sullivan (no courier charge this time). My best guess, when I saw the courier guy on the door with the big box, was that my copy of the free commercial software from Team Macromedia Management, but it turn out to to be something else.</p>
<p>There are 4 T-Shirts, 2 copies of MX Developer's Journal, Macromedia Flash for Windows and Macintosh (<em>the Analysis Pattern is not included, that is the one I am reading currently</em>), two CD-case, RoboDemo, RoboHelp and many ball-point pens. I will be gifting away all these in the next <a href="http://indiammug.com/" title="India's Macromedia User Group">IndiaMMUG</a> meeting.<br />
