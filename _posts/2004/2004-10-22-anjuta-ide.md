title: Anjuta IDE

[NabaKumar](http://naba.blogspot.com/) is the founder and lead developer of the [Anjuta IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjuta). He is a well known personality in the Linux community and the latest news is that he is getting married on Oct 25, 2004. My best wishes to them. Well, my sentiment here is that he turn out to be from the same small, remote town where I was born -- Manipur. The world is not enough and is indeed small. Anjuta is also the name of his would-be-wife.
