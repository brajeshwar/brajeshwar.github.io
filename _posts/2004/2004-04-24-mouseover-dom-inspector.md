# Mouseover DOM Inspector

A very good friend of mine, infact my `CSS Role Model`, sent me this link of a bookmarklet on [Mouseover DOM Inspector](http://slayeroffice.com/?c=/content/tools/modi.html).

> "This favelet allows you to view the properties of any HTML element on a page simply by mousing over the element. The element will be given a gray background, and a DIV element that trails the mouse cursor will contain the element type along with all of the specified attributes of the element."
