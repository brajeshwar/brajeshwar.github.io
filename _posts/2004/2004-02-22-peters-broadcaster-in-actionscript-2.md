# Peter's Broadcaster in ActionScript 2

A project was recently completed where AS2 was used to publish to Flash player 6,0,21,0 and above. One of the requirement was to use the AS1 Broadcaster from Peter Hall and avoid EventDispatcher. Thanks to Peter Hall and Darshan for their permission and help.
