title: Access Clipboard History with Alfred (Mac OS X)
---

Quite often, one of the suggestions for developers and designers is to have a tool or a utility to access your Clipboard History. There are indeed quite a free few good tools which sits in your menubar that does the job very well. Some of the most recommended free ones are <a href="http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/">Jumpcut</a> and <a href="http://www.clipmenu.com/">ClipMenu</a>.

However, if you're one of those <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> user who bought the <a href="https://buy.alfredapp.com/">Powerpack</a> (you should buy it, it's magic), it comes with a nifty Clipboard History Manager. One less menubar app to worry about.

> Before you can start using the Clipboard History feature, you need to enable it by going to the Preferences panel, under "Features > Clipboard". By default the Clipboard is disabled for privacy reasons.

Choose your choice of Clipboard history from 24 hours to 3 months. You can also set your desired Key Shortcut and Keyword. Remember to set it to ignore Password Manager apps - 1Password, Keychain Access, etc.

I prefer just typing "clip" to fire the clipboard history.

So, what's your favorite Clipboard Manager for OS X?
