# Access Clipboard History with Alfred

Quite often, one of the suggestions for developers and designers is to have a tool or a utility to access your Clipboard History. There are indeed quite a free few good tools which sits in your menubar that does the job very well. Some of the most recommended free ones are [Jumpcut](http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/), and [ClipMenu](http://www.clipmenu.com/).

However, if you’re one of those [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) user who bought the [Powerpack](https://buy.alfredapp.com/) (you should buy it, it’s magic), it comes with a nifty Clipboard History Manager. One less menubar app to worry about.

Before you can start using the Clipboard History feature, you need to enable it by going to the Preferences panel, under "Features > Clipboard". By default the Clipboard is disabled for privacy reasons.

Choose your choice of Clipboard history from 24 hours to 3 months. You can also set your desired Key Shortcut and Keyword. Remember to set it to ignore Password Manager apps - 1Password, Keychain Access, etc.

I prefer just typing `clip` in Alfred to fire the clipboard history.
