<blockquote><p>For 20 years Photoshop has played many different roles -- it has given creative people the power to deliver amazing images that impact every part of our visual culture and challenged the eye with its ability to transform photographs. It's no exaggeration to say that, thanks to millions of creative customers, Photoshop has changed the way the world looks at itself.</p></blockquote>
