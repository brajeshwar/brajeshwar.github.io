<p>What would happen if a MacBook and an iPad hooked up? One of the most amazing things Apple ever created: it is the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/">MacBook Air</a>! These slim beauties include flash storage, 802.11-N Wi-Fi and a Core 2 Duo processor. Apple has increased the size of the Air's battery enabling 5-7 hours of battery life when surfing over Wi-Fi and 30 days on standby time just like the iPad.</p>

<p>Weighing in at only 2.3 pounds (1.06 kg) for the 11-inch Model, the Airs are super light. Both the models measure only 0.68 inches at their thickest point and 0.11 inches at their thinnest point. The use of flash storage offers users a blinding speed when it comes to loading applications and accessing data.</p>
<p>The buttonless Multi-Touch trackpad lets you pinch, swipe, or rotate to adjust an image, zoom in on text, or advance through photo albums. The 11-inch model comes with either 64 GB or 128 GB flash storage, while the big brother packs 128 GB or 256 GB. What's the difference you ask? A major difference is that the 13.3-inch model sports a SD card reader and has a higher-resolution screen: 1440 by 900 pixels against the 11-incher's 1366 by 768 pixels. The MacBook Air costs between $1,000 and $1,600, depending on screen size and storage capacity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> today is positioning itself as a vertically integrated vendor of mobile devices, selling hardware, software as well as controlling the marketplace through which customers purchase software. The company is attempting to redefine the PC market the same way it has tackled the tablet and smartphone markets. Despite its position as an underdog in the PC industry, Apple dominates the premium end of the PC market.</p>
