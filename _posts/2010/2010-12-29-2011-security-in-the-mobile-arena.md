# 2011 - Security in the Mobile Arena

Security organization McAfee has professed that 2011 will see increased attacks on Apple merchandise like the iPhone and iPad, largely due to their in the business sector. McAfee said that Macs had thus far not been often targeted by malicious attackers, because they are not widely deployed.

## False Security?

McAfee cites a major problem of Apple users being unconcerned about malware and other security threats believing that they are secure because no one has attacked them yet. Their report said that the dearth of user understanding regarding exposure on these platforms and the dearth of deployed security options makes for a lucrative landscape for cybercriminals. McAfee said that Mac botnets created by Trojan Horse attacks will increase, as well. Virus and malware may arise as the growth of Apple is calling the attention of hackers, looking to steal sensitive data. Soothsayers have been predicting doom in the mobile arena and while it hasn't happened yet, it is still only a matter of time.

## Mobile Mayhem

In 2010 there were many rootkits for Android and remote jailbreaking tools for iPhone created. Since post jailbreak you can enter the device via SSH, pay more attention to passwords and turn off Bluetooth and SSH when not in use. McAfee said that 2011 is the year when the mobile arena becomes a cyber security battleground. "The move to stick mobile devices into business environments combined with these and other attacks is likely to bring about the explosion we've long anticipated," the company wrote. McAfee said that the popularity of iPads and iPhones in business environments and the easy portability of malicious code between them could put many users and businesses at risk next year and beyond. They anticipate threats of data and identity exposure.

## Lame Duck

Apple fans are accusing the anti-virus maker of spreading FUD in a bid to push their products to a market which has never used it and does not need it. The argument is that the Mac OS is completely secure and only Windows users suffer from software attacks. These are only predictions that are not based on anything concrete and the growing attraction of hackers may only provide more insights into the devices' capabilities.
