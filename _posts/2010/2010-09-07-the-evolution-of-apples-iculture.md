<p>The ability of <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> to consistently deliver innovative products and gratify consumers' needs (mostly latent needs) worldwide has brought them huge success. In continuation of this trend, Apple introduced its latest range of advanced <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPods</a> along with the much talked about and sought-after music machine <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">iPod Touch 4</a> which is said to function just like an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone 4</a> sans the phone. It is this consistency and the willingness to constantly offer technologically advanced products and services to consumers that makes Apple successful. </p>
<h3>iPod and the initial Success Story</h3>
<p>It all began with the launch of the iPod which essentially gave route to the destruction of businesses for companies producing Walkmans. The disruptive innovation called iPod instantly caught the attention of the youth and had Apple stores crowded with youngsters eager to grab on to an iPod of their own. With this, evolved Apple's iCulture wherein the initial versions of iPods like Nano and Shuffle familiarized consumers with the application of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>, and hence ruled the portable music market. </p>
<p>Now, Apple redefines the way consumers listen to music and thus comes the enhancement of the basic model from iPod to iPod Touch which in verity extends the association that consumers have with iTunes to more advanced applications and games similar to those existent in the iPhone. The addiction of consumers to <strong>iOS</strong> user interface and features would increase, enabling them to relish all the applications and games present in the iOS library. </p>
<h3>iPhone -- A step towards maturity</h3>
<p>The next stage of development is where users move from music devices to communication gadgets and the inevitable choice here, is the iPhone. Agreed, there subsists a wide array of Smartphones in the market to choose from, but picking any other phone would take away the iOS interface to which many users are habituated.  </p>
<h3>iPad -- A TABLET for advancement</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> was the first of its kind in the technology world that offers a platform for audio and visual media. But the existence of substitute products is evident in every product-category of Apple, as is the case for iPads with Samsung's launch of the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/204811/samsung_galaxy_tab_faces_challenges.html">Galaxy Tab</a>. There also are speculations that few more competitor Tablets would hit the market mostly functioning on Android, WebOS, the full Windows desktop OS, and the Windows Phone 7 mobile OS. Albeit, users who possess a consistent relationship with Apple and the iCulture, more naturally would prefer what they already know and hence get fixated to using the Apple iPad than buying a totally new product with a totally new library of applications.</p>
<p>It is the development of such phases by Apple that has brought about a new culture named the iCulture making it <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/2010/apple-the-cult-in-technology/">The Cult in Technology</a>. The ingredients for such a profitable culture involve -- innovations that generate addiction, youngsters, and frequent technological advancements. Various companies are setting out to achieve a similar sort of pattern that has the ability to achieve a fan base that is as addictive as the one that iCulture has achieved.</p>
