<p>If you were to poll a hundred serious business owners on the street and ask them if a website was a crucial part of starting a business, at least ninety would probably say it is. Yet, if you polled the same hundred people and asked what resources they put into their website, you would probably be shocked with the results.</p>
<p>If you think that your website is one of the most important elements to making your business successful, you should put some time and money into it. First of all, you need to be honest with yourself about your own web development skills. If your skills won't cut it and you don't have the time to learn, hire someone else. Period. You wouldn't try to rebuild the engine to your car if you didn't know how to change your oil? Why risk short circuiting your online image with a poorly designed website?</p>

<p>If you can't design your website yourself, you have two options. You can use a simple CSM (such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>) or hire someone else to build your site for you.</p>
<p>Assuming you are not going the easier route (which is often just as effective), you need to choose your web developer carefully. There is no sense paying for someone who is going to give you the same results (good or bad) that you would have had for free yourself. Remember that designing a website is a coordinated effort. In order to make an effective website, developers will need to use coders (front and back end) and graphics artists.</p>
<p>When you are actually making a decision to hire a web developer, you will find that the process does not have to be as intimidating as you would think. It is easier to assess the quality of a web developer than an SEO consultant. You can start by asking for portfolios and getting quotes from different developers. It is also a great idea to ask for testimonials from other customers. For more information, read <a href="http://www.geekinspired.com/web-development/8-things-to-know-before-hiring-a-web-developer/">8 Things to Know Before Hiring a Web Developer</a>. You can easily compare their quality and value and make an informed choice.</p>
<p>Developing a website for your business is not rocket science. Just remember to make the decision carefully and objectively. If a website is essential to your business, you will want to invest in it.</p>
