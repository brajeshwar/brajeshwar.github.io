  in most aspects in comparison to the veteran Windows XP or Windows Vista.

<p>If you're an avid lover of <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a> and <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp">SnagIt</a> - the two must have blogging tools to get things done, you got to be running a copy of Windows on your machine. I have always had a similar setup, as in a dual boot with Linux. There is nothing I've come across, that beats these tools in what they're capable of. </p>
<p>If <a href="http://www.cnet.com/windows-7/">reviews</a> are to be <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/12/windows-7-review/">believed</a>, Windows 7 has given its users a never before experience. For close to seven years, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-xp/default.aspx">Windows XP</a> has been an ardent resource to millions of users across the globe with around 71% users as compared to its successor, Windows Vista with a 19% share before Windows 7 was launched. This pretty much reveals the lack of interest that Windows Vista was able to create among the users in its short span of little below 3 yrs. Microsoft then came up with its latest offering in the Operating systems bandwagon - Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/">Windows 7</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Miller_(security_researcher)">Charlie Miller</a>, an award winning security researcher said,</p>
<blockquote><p>"Hacking into Windows 7 is a much more of a daunting task than hacking into Apple's recently launched Snow Leopard."</p></blockquote>

<p>Windows 7 predominantly focuses on overcoming the flaws of its predecessor (Vista), and is widely perceived as a much needed upgrade to a resource hogging and sluggish Vista. After using it for more than a month, I decided to come up with its <em>Good, Bad and Ugly</em>:</p>
<p>* <strong>Design</strong> - The most obvious and noticeable change in Windows 7 is its new shiny and smart design. The taskbar is transparent and loses it Quick launch feature only to be replaced by a new feature which allows the user to pin applications to the taskbar. The taskbar also brings in a new feature known as the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/products/features/jump-lists">Jump lists</a>, which allows user, an easy access to documents and commands that can run for a particular application. The show desktop icon on the far right does the obvious, but also hovering on this button makes all the open windows transparent allowing a quick overview, a feature also known as the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/peek">Aero Peek</a>.<br />
* <strong>Install and Boot times</strong> - The installation time is not drastically reduced from that of Vista, but Windows 7 sure is lightweight and fast and can deliver on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The startup and shutdown time is definite improvement, making it a smooth &amp; stable contender.<br />
* <strong>Security</strong> - The Windows Security Center, now known as Windows Action Center in Windows 7 integrates both the system security and maintenance. Microsoft has worked on the User Account Control security feature to reduce the unnecessary security pop-ups that kept irritating a user in Vista.</p>
<p>Other notable features include improved touch and handwriting recognition, windows media center with improved extender functionality for game consoles and a neat virtual hard drive support.  I typically liked omission of a certain features and services like - Windows Mail, Movie Maker and Live Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>One major qualm with Windows 7 is the hit that it takes in terms of performance in most aspects in comparison to the veteran Windows XP or Windows Vista.</p>
<p>A rather disappointing part about Windows 7 could be the fact that users currently running Windows XP, have to go for a clean install if they need to move on to Windows 7. That calls for a denial but many of them. The other fact is the price for upgrading from Vista to Windows 7. How many people who bought a Vista machine 6 months ago would be willing to spend another 119$ to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/buy/default.aspx">upgrade to Windows 7</a> Home Premium?</p>
<p>Microsoft's efforts in plugging the holes created by Vista seems to have taken the right direction so far in the form of Windows 7.</p>
<p>How do you find your operating system - <em>Good, bad or Ugly</em>?</p>
