# Acer launches Tablets, Smartphones and Dual-Screen Notebooks

<a href="http://www.acer.com/">Acer</a> which is more often than not known for its efficient Notebooks and its customized production of <a href="http://mobile.acer.com/en/phones/liquidFerrari/">Ferrari Smartphones</a>, now wants to gain a lot of attention. This attention-grabbing stint of Acer will be through the launch of not just one product, but the unveiling of a whole range of new-age hardware products which shall cater to a future-ready consumer audience. In the earlier days (early 2000) it was and even now is to some extent, Apple which regularly comes up with novel products that are termed legendarily as ground-breaking innovations. In the recent past, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is slowly but steadily facing competition from several players who also seem to have started making headlines with their innovative product-launches.

The products that were unveiled by Acer include dual-screen laptop, a high-resolution Android phone, and several tablets. Let's take a look at a brief description of each of these products:

## The Acer Android Tablets

There would be 2 kinds of tablets from Acer; one with the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/23/acer-introduces-7-inch-and-10-inch-android-tablets/">Android OS</a> and another with <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/23/acer-debuts-10-1-inch-windows-7-tablet-amd-powered-inbuilt-3g/">Windows 7 OS</a>. The Android held tablets will also have two sub-tablets -- a 7" version and another 10.1" version with both of them bearing the same 1280x800 resolution. The difference in both tablets can be spotted in the processor, wherein a 1.0 GHz dual-core processor and a 1.2 GHz dual-core chip exist in the 10.1" and 7" models respectively. These products are expected to hit markets during the month of April, 2011 and the reason for this delay appears to be the lack of the latest version of Android. The only detailing about the Windows 7 Tablet is that it'll run on AMD silicon instead of Intel's. Rumor also has it that the Windows Tablet is supposedly a stunner in terms of its looks.

## The Android Smartphone

As mentioned earlier, Acer is no mug with Smartphone production as it already has expertise in manufacturing the Ferrari Smartphones. The configuration of this new Smartphone embedded with Android OS is as follows -- a 4.8" display with a staggering 1024x480 resolution all-metal enclosure, and the usual list of connection options. In addition to this, it also has 2 cameras, a six-axis gyroscope and accelerometer, etc. Similar to the Tablets the Smartphone too will only be out by April, 2011.

## Dual-screen Laptop

Now for the most interesting and the best of them all -- the dual-screen Acer laptop which is charmingly called <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/23/acer-rivals-libretto-w105-with-iconia-dual-screen-laptop-table/">Iconia</a>. Let me just take a large breathe and put its entire configuration in one sentence. Here goes,

It runs on Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit) and is equipped with an Intel Core i5-480M/560M/580M CPU, up to 4GB of DDR3 memory, a pair of 14-inch multitouch displays (1366x768 resolution), integrated Intel HD graphics (128MB RAM), VGA/HDMI outputs, an inbuilt microphone and a S/PDIF interface and there is also a 320/500/640/750GB hard drive, Acer's CrystalEye webcam (1280x1024 resolution), 802.11b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 3.0+HS, integrated 3G WWAN, gigabit Ethernet, a four-cell battery and a total weight of 6.18 poundsa pair of USB 2.0 ports, a single USB 3.0 jack and a one-year warranty.

Phew! Though it shall take some time in getting used to a touch-sensitive keyboard just like the way we got used to touch screen phones, it seems like quite a handy and helpful device. Definitely innovative!

With these products and more, we sure hope Acer can capture a good share in today's technologically advanced market. But the delay in them being available to end-consumers could just take the thunder away from them, by which time new competitors could also emerge. Acer needs to badly reduce the lead-time between the launch and the availability of its gen-next products.
