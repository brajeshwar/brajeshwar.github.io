<p>For all those Mac or iOS developers hard at work coding ceaselessly, lest Santa thinks you've been naughty here's some good news! Santa's coming early, bringing with him <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple's</a> latest offering of a bunch of iOS and Mac development books in the iBookstore for Free!</p>
<p>The six developer guides may not appeal to non-coders, but for those hard-core, full blown coders, choose between titles like iOS Human Interface Guidelines, Object Oriented Programming With Objective-C, or Cocoa Fundamentals Guide. Wait a minute, you don't have to choose, they are all gratis. The other three titles are The Objective-C Programming Language, iOS Technology Overview, and its thrilling sequel iOS Application Programming Guide.</p>
<p>You'll need to fire up <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/ibooks.html">iBooks</a> on your iPad or iPhone to get these books since Santa only climbs down these chimneys to drop off your presents. Apple says that these free books work best with the recently-released iBooks 1.2.</p>
