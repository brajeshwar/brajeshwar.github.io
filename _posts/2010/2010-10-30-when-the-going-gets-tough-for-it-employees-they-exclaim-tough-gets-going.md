<p>It does seem as though the going will get tougher for people who are struggling to make it big in the IT industry, especially for those residing in developed nations like America and England. Aspirations to build a career in IT, could demand you to move to regions like Jonesboro, Ark., Sebeka, Minn., or Macon, Mo. Thanks to the new trend called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_outsourcing">Rural Outsourcing</a> employees are having to choose to settle in such rural areas in order to make their mark in the technology field. </p>
<p>Stiff competition and the desperation to retain clients has lead IT firms to quote lower costs to their clients and to facilitate this, firms have taken to <a href="http://www.openforum.com/idea-hub/topics/managing/article/forget-outsourcing-try-rural-sourcing-anne-field">Rural Off-Shoring</a>. Technology workers, who consider moving, must make several changes not just in terms of their work culture but also in terms of their lifestyle. There must at least be present in the individual's psyche - some sort of liking towards rural life; a real zeal to start, grow and make it big in the IT sector; no problems with constant traveling and relocating. These are some points that should exist in the IT job aspirant's mind whilst he makes the decision of joining an onshore outsourcing IT firm.</p>

<p>Some IT personnel take this leap for the purpose of securing a solid job in an organization and hence adjust to the lifestyle of rural areas. Speaking of such life-altering changes, Software engineer Dora Eitel described that she made the right choice of joining <a href="http://www.onshoretechnology.com/">Onshore Technology Services</a> in Macon, Mo and stated "I could probably move to a larger city to earn a higher wage, but I moved to a rural community for the lifestyle it offers versus the lifestyle and chaos of city living."</p>
<p>Evidently, those who find it comfortable to live in rural set-ups have no issues in taking up jobs in sub-urban and rural locations. However, people who have been bred in developed nations find it tough to adapt to rural living. Also, issues related to living costs and salaries drawn are matters of concern specifically for those who are used to being paid high salaries. An instance of <a href="http://www.cross-usa.com/">CrossUSA</a> reveals that newly recruited professionals earn 30 to 40 percent less than what they made in their previous IT job. To top this off, lower salaries aren't necessarily matched by lower expenses. </p>
<p>"The largest benefits for talent working with a rural outsourcing firm are the opportunities to experience broad technologies, industries, and business sectors that wouldn't otherwise be available locally," says Andy Speer, vice president of technology services at <a href="http://www.technisource.com/">Technisource</a>, an IT staffing firm. Read more on the <a href="http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/blogs/all/rural-outsourcings-impact-on-it-employment/?cs=43854">impact</a> that Rural Outsourcing has on IT employment.</p>
<p>All this summarizes the fact that there are certain things one needs to give up in order to gain certain other things. To attain the benefit of working with large-scale technologies and industries, one needs to make monetary sacrifices; to attain a long-term and secure IT job one needs to learn to live in rural localities.</p>
