<p>Adobe always keeps up the good job of offering users with state-of-the-art products and solutions and each time ensures that the lives of the users is made easier and uncomplicated with the fabrication of simple and user friendly products and solutions. Continuing this trend, Adobe has added yet another upgrade to it's existing large array of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/">product offerings</a>. This time the addition is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/psprelements/">Photoshop Elements 9 & Premiere Elements 9 Bundle</a> which is considered one of the best consumer photo and video editing software. Both softwares are available in one retail package (bundle) at a very reasonable price of $149.99 (or $99.99 for each) and the Premiere Elements comes to Mac for the first time.</p>
<p>Kevin Connor, Vice President of product management for Digital Imaging, Adobe said, "For the first time, both <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/">Mac</a> users can do more with their photos and video with Photoshop Elements 9 and Premiere Elements 9 bundle -- a unified solution for all photo and video needs." And by more, he means that users can enjoy the features that the existing products and solutions have got to offer and also a range of new augmentations that have been made to the new version, which facilitates users in a far better way. </p>
<p>Let us have a glimpse at some of the enhanced features that Adobe's latest Photoshop Elements 9 & Premiere Elements 9 has got to offer --</p>
<p>* The Content Aware Fill and the Spot Brush features available in the Photoshop Elements 9 together examines the image to be worked on and immediately mends it with the swipe of the brush (removing anything from the background).<br />
* Premiere Elements 9 which is more to do with videos enables the creation of movies within very little time and the intelligent tools existent in the product would eradicate any audio problems, bad footage, shaky shots, bad color and lighting problems that occur whilst the movie is being created. There is also the ease of converting any video into an animated one and with its excellent performance, video editing becomes smooth and viewing in HD becomes easy.<br />
* With improved Organizer tools, Adobe's latest product version facilitates easy sharing amenities as users can easily upload and import pictures or videos from the trendiest <a href="http://www.theflip.com/">Flip Video camcorders</a>, iPhone and DSLR cameras.<br />
* Adobe also claims "the Auto-Analyzer helps users tag the best photos and videos and also identifies specific faces in photos. Users can quickly post photos and videos directly to Facebook, combine media together into dynamic interactive Online Albums and create an online DVD-like viewing experience to share with friends and family."</p>
<p>If all this were not enough, Adobe users are showered with extra benefits in the form of Plus, whereby an additional storage space (majorly for backup saving and sharing) of 20 GB is offered for $49.99. With this users can store up to 15,000 photos and 4 hours of DVD-quality video. Apart from this, Plus also grants new tutorials, artwork and interactive online templates for users to learn from.</p>
<p>The only setback that can be seen with this new version is that it is only for Microsoft and Mac users depriving other OS users (like Linux) from being acquainted to Adobe's newest Photoshop Elements 9 & Premiere Elements 9 Bundle.</p>
