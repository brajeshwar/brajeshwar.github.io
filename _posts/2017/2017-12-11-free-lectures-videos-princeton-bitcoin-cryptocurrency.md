# Free Lectures (videos) from Princeton on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency

You have definitely heard of [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) and wanted to know all the details. Bitcoin is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. It was the first practical implementation and is currently the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in existence.

Here are a [series of lectures](https://piazza.com/princeton/spring2015/btctech/home) from Princeton University on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency. The lectures are technical and address some important questions about Bitcoin, such as:

How does Bitcoin work? What makes Bitcoin different? How secure are your Bitcoins? How anonymous are Bitcoin users? What determines the price of Bitcoins? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? What might the future hold?

After this course, you'll know everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You'll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And you'll be able to integrate ideas from Bitcoin in your own projects.

Here are the 11 video lectures.
