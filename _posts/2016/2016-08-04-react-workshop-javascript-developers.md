<p>The <a href="https://alarisprime.com/">Alaris Prime</a> Team, recently, completed a highly performant re-write of the front end visual layer of Aditya Birla's flagship eCommerce site <a href="http://www.abof.com/">ABOF.com</a>. The team was able to make the site exceptionally fast, even on a low 3G Bandwidth connection in India. The CEO of ABOF happily claims their site is the fastest eCommerce site in India.

<p>We believe that it is a good practice to teach others what we experienced. We have decided to do an extensive 2-Day hands-on Workshop on React, for JavaScript Developers - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/design-frontend/events/232127251/">React in-depth for JavaScript Developers</a>.</p>
<p>Seats are limited to a max of 10 developers. Bring your development friendly computers.</p>
<p>We were planning to charge a premium for the workshop to make sure only the most interested developers can join and benefit. However, we have decided against it.  but the seats will remain limited to 10.</p>
