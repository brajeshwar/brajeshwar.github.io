<p>In many ways, founding a startup is more challenging than starting a traditional business. Of course, entrepreneurs want to make money when they start a traditional business. However, startup founders must prove that their idea will grow into a large corporation. This is quite a bit of pressure.</p>
<p>For this reason, startup founders are a unique breed. Luckily, there’s also a unique source of help if you alone or you and your team are brave enough to say, “One day this concept or product will be as big as Facebook.”</p>
<p>There are many startup accelerators that offer startup founders access to</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial assistance,</li>
<li>Specialized business training,</li>
<li>Counseling,</li>
<li>Legal guidance, and</li>
<li>much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most accelerators like to focus on one type of startup. For example, some only work with tech startups. Others work with startups that have a certain structure, like team-based startups.  </p>
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>Most accelerators will offer you mentorship, workspace, operational support and access to funding via introductions to angel investors or outright payments. Program durations run anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. Many programs are quite competitive and only accept 2 to 10 startups a year.</p>
