<p>Entrepreneurship is not all glitz and glamor like the movies would have you believe. Contrary to popular belief, entrepreneurs don't work hard for 6 months and then become an overnight success. There is a huge amount of effort that is put forth and sustained for years before success happens.</p>
<p>Even though there are few things in this world that are more satisfying, challenging, and financially lucrative as entrepreneurship, it's not for everyone. Everyone is not willing to put forth the effort or sacrifice what it takes to make it as an entrepreneur. Here are few thoughts about entrepreneurship that everyone should know. </p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/08/entrepreneurship-1024x403.jpg" alt="http://" width="600" height="236" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6846" /></p>
<h2>It takes a long time to become successful</h2>
<p>When a successful entrepreneur is highlighted, it is usually their success and money that is at the forefront of the story. This leads readers to falsely believing that these tech billionaires and super successful entrepreneurs are merely "lucky". </p>
<p>What they don't highlight is the struggles and years of hard work and labor. Startup website <a href="http://fundersandfounders.com/">Funders and Founders</a> highlights the hardships of some of the world's most successful billionaire entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>One infographic on the site, <a href="http://fundersandfounders.com/too-late-to-start-life-crisis/">"Too Late to Start?"</a>, highlights the fact that most of these successful entrepreneurs started their journeys between the ages of 35-39.</p>
<h2>There are a million failures before a single win</h2>
<p>Another common aspect of the entrepreneurial journey that people seem to ignore is the fact that the most successful entrepreneurs have failed a million times before getting it right. It take an incredible amount of perseverance to continue in the face of failure. </p>
<h2>Many entrepreneurs sacrifice having a social life</h2>
<p>Another extremely important aspect of being an entrepreneur is having to sacrifice a social life. You don't realize how much time it takes to nurture friendships, marriages, and relationships with children until you become an entrepreneur. All of this has to sometimes be sacrificed for a certain amount of time to give your business the life it needs to survive. </p>
<p>If you read the stories of the world's most successful billionaire entrepreneurs, you'll see that being a successful entrepreneur is anything but easy. Yes, everyone wants to have the money and accolades of successful entrepreneurs but not everyone is ready to do what it takes to get it.</p>
<p>What do you have to say about entrepreneurship? Are you one? How is your story so far?</p>
