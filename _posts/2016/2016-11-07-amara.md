# Amara

Unlike our first daughter, [Laaija](https://laaija.com/), Amara's birth was very well planned and scheduled. The family started very early from home around 5:00am in the morning, to get Shanta admitted to the [Rainbow Hospital](https://www.rainbowhospitals.in), Bannerghatta, Bangalore.

Without any complications and under the care of Dr. Ashwini GB, [Amara](https://amara.oinam.com/) was born at 9:19AM on Nov 7, 2016. She has the same blood group as me, and her sister, B+.

Like most babies born these days, Amara had Neonatal Jaundice, and had to under Light Therapy treatment. I stayed up few nights holding her against the UV light so she gets optimal light on her, while she slept.

The next day, India had its [banknote demonetisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation) event and we had our small experiences of it. I remember an incident where I was trying to buy dinner for the family, ended up walking quite a few kilometers before I could find a restaurant where I can buy chicken dinner for Laaija.
