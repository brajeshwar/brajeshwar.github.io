<p>Although the on-demand industry is highly popular, not all businesses remain successful. Recently the food-delivery service <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spoonrocket">SpoonRocket</a> announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/spoonrocket-shuts-down/">shutting down</a>. Prior to closing, the business accomplished meal sales at a profit, but the cost of operations exceeded the funding they were able to raise. In addition, their business model of cheap, quickly delivered food did not draw in the customer base required to sustain it - many customers reported dissatisfaction with the quality of the meals, preferring to spend more money for tastier alternatives. The management attempted to organize an acquisition instead of terminating the business, but the deal ultimately failed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sprig.com/">Sprig</a>, a strong competitor of SpoonRocket, has attracted many of the customers and ex-employees of the closing business. The SpoonRocket management team actively recommended Sprig as part of their <a href="http://blog.spoonrocket.com/post/141093499941/goodbye">closing announcement</a>, offering discount coupons for SpoonRocket customers who chose to transition. Despite Sprig's service being slower and the cost higher, many customers find its quality superior and its sustainable, organic sourcing appealing. </p>
<p>Several additional alternatives exist for ex-employees or customers of SpoonRocket. <a href="https://www.trycaviar.com/about-us">Caviar</a>, a service that partners with restaurants in over a dozen major cities, allows customers to order from their favorite locations. For people who prefer to cook, <a href="https://www.doordash.com/about/">DoorDash</a> permits customers to order groceries from local suppliers for delivery in less than 45 minutes. Another option, <a href="https://postmates.com/about">Postmates</a>, is headquartered in San Francisco, and aims to grant customers access to goods from any local store or restaurant.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons why food-delivery startup SpoonRocket shut down, the on-demand industry remains strong and its opportunities promising.</p>
