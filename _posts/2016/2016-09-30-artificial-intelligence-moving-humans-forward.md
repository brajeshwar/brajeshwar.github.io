# Artificial Intelligence - moving humans forward

Ever since we figured out how to put a computer in every home, someone has been asking the question "will robots or artificial intelligence replace humans in the workforce?" The answer, of course, is yes. They have and will continue to do so as we find areas where a robot can do the work better or where a job is unsafe for a human to do. But the typical robot doing a repetitive job is not necessarily "intelligent". Artificial Intelligence, on the other hand, is something entirely different.

The theory that computer systems and applications can someday replace humans has been held in both fear and awe. Applications for artificial intelligence, however, continue to drive forward and at a faster pace than ever. As development companies collect user data and build smarter applications, algorithms using that data can make the applications gain abilities making them appear to learn, grow and adapt to surroundings and circumstances. The data can be applied using these algorithms to serve nearly any industry. 

<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence">Merriam-webster</a> dictionary defines Artificial Intelligence as, "an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence."

This means that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not limited to robots or some sort of android type of computer. Pretty much artificial intelligence is a set of code that learns over time. So does this mean AI can really advance to the point where it takes over our daily lives and takes the place of humans in every way? The answer is possibly.

For years we have all worried that we would be replaced by robots and to some extent that has come to pass. So why shouldn't AI replace us in some fashion in the future?

A few of these jobs might look something like this:

1. Order Clerks
1. Data Entry Operators
1. Library Technicians
1. Photocopy Operators
1. Tax Preparations
1. Telemarketers

PC Magazine published a list of <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2459986,00.asp">20 Jobs Likely to Be Replaced by Robots</a>.

But what if instead of removing the need for human knowledge worker, AIs actually enhanced the workplace and made more jobs for humans in the long run. Machines running programs have taken much of the human error out of documenting many types of information and doing precise tasks.

But the need for a human to somehow enter this information into the program still exists. So even though artificial intelligence is capable of "learning" quickly. How do you replace a life time of intuition that a human accumulates in a short amount of time?

Some areas where a life this life experience will still be valuable are:

1. Recreational Therapists
1. Occupational Therapists
1. Healthcare social workers
1. Physicians and surgeons - even though robots are being used extensively in this field the human touch may still be needed
1. First-line supervisors of police and detectives
1. Elementary School Teachers - this may be a grey area also, some technology will move into these jobs but there is still some need for humans.

There is no stopping the progress of this technology and who knows what will happen in the future. We just need to restructure and educate our workforce to compensate so humans and Artificial Intelligence can be put in areas where each are best suited for the job at hand.

Recently, TechRepublic concisely noted <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/7-trends-for-artificial-intelligence-in-2016-like-2015-on-steroids/">some of the most exciting trends</a> in the field even beyond robotic factory workers and driverless cars. Application of AI into customer service, data processing, and even our children's toys mean that we will see AI in our personal lives and in our work to a greater extent. 

Walk through any big-box retailer and observe everyday items connected to the Internet - our cars, our refrigerators, our televisions - the tech companies at the forefront of AI are gathering data on us and how we live, what we like or dislike at heightened speeds and with greater capacity. Using this data, companies can improve our customer experience at a deeper level when computers adapt to understand emotions by listening to the tone of voice and using facial recognition looking for subtle changes in expression.

At the core of our understanding and use of artificial intelligence remains discovery into the ethical issues surrounding the topic. Is it right to replace workers? How much data is too much? Are there risks to continuing this trend? Some of these questions would have highly personal answers. How we respond as a collective may influence the direction this trend takes in the future.
