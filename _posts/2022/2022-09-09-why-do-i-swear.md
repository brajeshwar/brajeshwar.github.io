# Why do I Swear?

[Everything I know](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-I-Know-Paul-Jarvis-ebook/dp/B00GRBIFH6) is an interesting book by Paul Jarvis. Here is one piece of the book that resonated with me - why do I swear?

I tend to swear quite a bit, be it at home, in meetings, or at work. Yes, I know that swearing makes me look bad, rather uncreative, and unprofessional, especially in business situations.

However, I try not to use profanity just to make a point. I swear because I swear. I have always loved to be on the alternate side of equations that most normal people would avoid. I want to question things others might otherwise take for granted. I swear about situations, the outcome, and the results but not to someone or the person causing the concern. 

Everyone makes mistakes, and I have made many mistakes in my life. I respect people who make mistakes.
