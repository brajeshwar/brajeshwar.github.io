# Plain Text

I was once an [Evernote](https://evernote.com) user since its early days and a premium subscriber for many years. I have used many notetaking apps and bought enough of them -- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), [ByWord](https://bywordapp.com), [Bear](https://bear.app), [SimpleNote](https://simplenote.com), [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) fork of [Notational Velocity](https://notational.net/), etc.

I have moved to a simpler notetaking and writing habit for my notes. I have chosen a simple plain-text life. The idea is to approach __contents as data-first with tools on the top__. I have grown to like the simple methods I use and the philosophies of managing the files and the directories/folders.

My default is to start with Apple’s Notes to add quicknotes, share common family notes,  and as a scratch pad for everything. If needed, I transfer and add them to the correct folder along with all of my notes in my __Notebook__. Right now, I use Obsidian[^Obsidian] to manage my notes. The beauty of this setup is that I can change tools anytime, while my notes remain free of any dependency.

For team writing, I'd be happy to use whatever helps the team write better and easier for everyone.

> [Plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) is a powerful universal tool that is almost zero cost, work across platforms, are light enough to work remotely over poor connections, doesn't go out of date, and is quick to learn.

Plain text is software and operating system agnostic. It's searchable, portable, lightweight, and easily manipulated. It's unstructured. It works when web servers are down, or the Internet is not working. There's no exporting and importing, no databases or tags or flags or stars or prioritizing or any other proprietary induced rules on what you can and can't do with it.

The only additional formatting I'm comfortable adding is Markdown[^Markdown]. It is designed to be human readable. It's not obfuscated by encoding; you can directly edit the source files with most editors, or edit them automatically with scripts. My own limitation is to stay within the confines of human readability -- the Markdown text files should still be readable by someone who has no clue about Markdown.

Of course, Plain Text has its limitations and disadvantages. The User Experience is not that good. It is entirely dependent on the tools that can support it. It has no rules and makes it harder to be disciplined in maintaining them.
