# Plain Text

Plain Text Notetaking is one of the best habits you can build up. It will pay you back, compounding as time goes on and as software and apps come and go.

I was once an [Evernote](https://evernote.com) user since its early days and a premium subscriber for many years. I have used many note-taking apps and bought enough of them — [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), [ByWord](https://bywordapp.com), [Typora](https://typora.io),  [Bear](https://bear.app), [SimpleNote](https://simplenote.com), [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) fork of [Notational Velocity](https://notational.net/), etc.

I have moved to a simpler note-taking and writing habit for my notes. I have chosen a simple, plain-text[^plaintext] life. The idea is to approach __contents as data-first with tools on the top__. I have grown to like the simple methods I use and the philosophies of managing the files and the directories/folders.

For short, quick notes, I tend to start with Apple’s Notes, share common family notes, and as a scratch pad for everything. If needed, I transfer and add them to the correct folder along with all my notes in my **Notebook**. Right now, I use Obsidian[^Obsidian] to manage my notes. The beauty of this setup is that I can change tools anytime while my notes remain free of any dependency.

The simplicity of storing plain-text files as individual files is much more helpful than storing them in a database and having an export format. Directly manipulating files allows multiple apps to coexist, change, or migrate to other apps and do helpful things on top of the duplicate files.

For team writing, I’d be happy to use whatever helps the team write better and easier for everyone.

Plain text is software and operating system-agnostic. It’s searchable, portable, lightweight, and easily manipulated. It’s unstructured. It works when web servers are down or the Internet is not working. There’s no exporting and importing, no databases or tags or flags or stars or prioritizing or any other proprietary induced rules on what you can and can’t do with it.

The only additional formatting I’m comfortable adding is Markdown[^Markdown]. It is designed to be human-readable. It’s not obfuscated by encoding; you can directly edit the source files with most editors or edit them automatically with scripts. My self-imposed limitation is to stay within the confines of human readability — the Markdown text files should still be readable by someone without a clue about Markdown.

Of course, Plain Text has its limitations and disadvantages. The User Experience could be better. It is entirely dependent on the tools that can support it. It has no rules, which makes it harder to be disciplined in maintaining them.

[^plaintext]: [Plain Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) is a loose term for data that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects. It may also include a limited number of “whitespace” characters that affect simple arrangement of text, such as spaces, line breaks, or tabulation characters. Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information is included; from structured text, where structural parts of the document such as paragraphs, sections, and the like are identified; and from binary files in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects.

[^Obsidian]: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a powerful knowledge base on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. With Obsidian, your data sits in a local folder. Obsidian works completely offline, internet or service issues will never be your problem.

[^Markdown]: [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) and [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. It is well established, open, and easy to jump in.
