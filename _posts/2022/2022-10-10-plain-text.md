# Plain Text

I have moved to a simpler note-taking and writing habit. I have chosen a simple plain-text life. The idea is to approach contents as data-first with tools on the top.

> Plain text is a powerful universal tool that is almost zero cost, work across platforms, are light enough to work remotely over poor connections, doesn't go out of date, and is quick to learn.

Plain text is software and operating system agnostic. It's searchable, portable, lightweight, and easily manipulated. It's unstructured. It works when web servers are down, or the Internet is not working. There's no exporting and importing, no databases or tags or flags or stars or prioritizing or any other proprietary induced rules on what you can and can't do with it.

The only additional formatting I'm comfortable adding is [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (initially developed by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)). MarkDown is well established, open, and easy to jump in. My only limit is to stay within the confines of human readability -- it should still be readable by someone who has no clue about Markdown.

Of course, Plain Text has its limitations and disadvantages. The User Experience is not that good. It is entirely dependent on the tools that can support it. It has no rules and makes it harder to be disciplined in maintaining them.

Here are a few good references that will get you started, stay productive, and lead a simpler, plain-text lifestyle.
