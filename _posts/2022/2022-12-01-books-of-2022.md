# Books of 2022

I'm very far from being religious at all. However, I have always wanted to know more about how people, almost all of them, can be extremely religious. I decided to read the religious books -- the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible), the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran), and the [Gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita).

[Need to look at the books of Jainism, Bahaism, Judaism, Sikhism, Buddhism]

I read [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382) by Greg McKeown in 2017. It is a good book, worthy of re-reads.

"Less but Better." It is a book you need to re-read to remind you that we are spread too thin to be doing too many things, and how/why we need to learn to say NO. We always underestimate how long a task will take. We are socially not good at saying NO and try to help whenever possible. It's easy to say yes to requests in the moment and underestimate the required work, and  then get overwhelmed with the work later. Remember, doing any work needs prep-time, and most work usually has a hangover afterwards. Try to rethink on how to set goals and re-evaluate your activities.

I decided to read the other books by [Greg McKeown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_McKeown_(author)) -- Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter, and Effortless: Make It Easier to Do What Matters Most.

[Effortless: Make It Easier to Do What Matters Most](https://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Make-Easier-What-Matters/dp/0593135644/)

[Project Hail Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary) is a science fiction novel by [Andy Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Weir). It is his third novel, after [The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)), and [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_(novel)). A scientific mystery, spiced up with an interstellar journey, the novel is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival of the protagonist in the story, Ryland Grace.

One day I told my daughter that I noticed her reading a lot less. She said, she is no more into kid books and wants to try the likes of -- [The Art of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War). So, I dropped my Kindle copy to hers and bought the Hardcover version too. I re-read The Art of War and it was fun to read it again.

In [The Code Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_Breaker), [Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson) goes deep and technical to talk about [Jennifer Doudna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Doudna), a biochemist who has done pioneering work in CRISPR gene editing, received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with [Emmanuelle Charpentier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuelle_Charpentier), "for the development of a method for genome editing." This is another of Walter's massive books with rather long winding life-stories of scientists, students, post-doctoral candidates, engineers, and and many others in the book. This is going to be a very long read, and can stay on the stand/shelf for a very long time without the need to finish it off at one-go.

In [The Creativity Code](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Code-Learning-Write-Paint-dp-0008288151/dp/0008288151/), [Marcus du Sautoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy), a Mathematician and author, toys with the idea of a future where machine learning will disrupt, enrich, and transform our understanding of what it means to be creative. The book is for creatives, and lovers of science without necessarily the need to be good at complex mathematics. The author smoothens the mathematics involved for the common man.

[Will](https://willthebook.com) is a memoir by [Will Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith). You will love it if you are still a fan of Will Smith. He is an awesome actor and loved most of his movies. Personally, I was unable to bring myself to love his book. This is indeed a good book but personally, a hard-read for me. Perhaps, a dramatized movie would be nicer where one can just spend a few hours and finish it off. You should still read it once.
