In [The Creativity Code](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Code-Learning-Write-Paint-dp-0008288151/dp/0008288151/), [Marcus du Sautoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy), a Mathematician and author, toys with the idea of a future where machine learning will disrupt, enrich, and transform our understanding of what it means to be creative. The book is for creatives, and lovers of science without necessarily the need to be good at complex mathematics. The author smoothens the mathematics involved for the common man.
