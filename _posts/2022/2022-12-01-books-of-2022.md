[The Code Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_Breaker) by [Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson)

In [The Creativity Code](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Code-Learning-Write-Paint-dp-0008288151/dp/0008288151/), [Marcus du Sautoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy), a Mathematician and author, toys with the idea of a future where machine learning will disrupt, enrich, and transform our understanding of what it means to be creative. The book is for creatives, and lovers of science without necessarily the need to be good at complex mathematics. The author smoothens the mathematics involved for the common man.

[Will](https://willthebook.com) is a memoir by [Will Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith). You will love it if you are still a fan of Will Smith. He is an awesome actor and loved most of his movies. Personally, I was unable to bring myself to love his book. This is indeed a good book but personally, a hard-read for me. Perhaps, a dramatized movie would be nicer where one can just spend a few hours and finish it off. You should still read it once.
