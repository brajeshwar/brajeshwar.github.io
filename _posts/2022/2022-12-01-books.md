# Books of 2022

I'm very far from being religious. However, I have always wanted to know more about how people have strong religious beliefs. I decided to read the religious books such as the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible), [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran), and the [Gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita). Further, I'm interested and will be reading up on Jainism, Bahaism, Judaism, Sikhism, Buddhism (read [Buddhism Plain and Simple](https://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-Plain-Simple-Practice-Being/dp/0804843368/) by Steve Hagen), and others.

[1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale by [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell). Published on Jun 8, 1949, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. The book highlights the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future in 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda.

Like everyone else, I have read [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind) and am planning to read [Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow). So, it was natural to read [21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Lessons_for_the_21st_Century) by [Yuval Noah Harari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari). The book is about where we are and how we can move forward. It bridges the gap between Sapiens, which was about our past, and Homo Deus, which is about our future. The book looks at where we stand technologically and politically, debunking myths and suggesting ways we can combat "post-truth".

[Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear is one of the most recommended book and I re-read it again, extracted quite a few of the habits I want to enforce and enhance. It depends a lot on what type of a life you want to lead, and at the end of the day, make it a habit at doing the activities that you want to be good it. Learn to have a routine, and keep enhancing it, and be discipline to stick to your schedules. A lot of articles have been written about it and a whole of lot of people swear by it. Read the book, and make up your own style, and don't hesitate to keep changing it.

# D

[Discipline Is Destiny: The Power of Self-Control](https://www.disciplineisdestiny.com) is yet another self-helf book from [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/) and is indeed another good read. If you have read all of his earlier books, you might find this not so different. However, it was good just finishing up all of the books.

# E

I read [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382) by Greg McKeown in 2017. It is a good book, worthy of re-reads.

"Less but Better." It is a book you need to re-read to remind you that we are spread too thin to be doing too many things, and how/why we need to learn to say NO. We always underestimate how long a task will take. We are socially not good at saying NO and try to help whenever possible. It's easy to say yes to requests in the moment and underestimate the required work, and  then get overwhelmed with the work later. Remember, doing any work needs prep-time, and most work usually has a hangover afterwards. Try to rethink on how to set goals and re-evaluate your activities.

I decided to read the other books by [Greg McKeown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_McKeown_(author)) -- [Multipliers: How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipliers:_How_the_Best_Leaders_Make_Everyone_Smarter), and [Effortless: Make It Easier to Do What Matters Most](https://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Make-Easier-What-Matters/dp/0593135644/).

Well, wanted to be good parents to our kids, so started with [Bringing up Bébé](https://www.amazon.com/Bringing-Up-Bébé-Discovers-Parenting/dp/1594203334/), learnt [How to Talk so Kids will Listen and Listen so Kids will Talk](https://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen/dp/1451663870/), and was even [Prepared](https://www.amazon.com/Prepared-What-Kids-Need-Fulfilled/dp/1984826069) while [Reviving Ophelia](https://www.amazon.com/Reviving-Ophelia-Saving-Selves-Adolescent/dp/0756984807/). Now, we want to just settle on being [A Good Enough Parent](https://goodenoughparenting.com).

[How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World]() is a brilliant book by Steven Johnson. The book is about the history of innovation over centuries, tracing facets of modern life (refrigeration, clocks, and eyeglass lenses, etc.) from their creation by hobbyists, amateurs, and entrepreneurs to their unintended historical consequences. Filled with surprising stories of accidental genius and brilliant mistakes — from the French publisher who invented the phonograph before Edison but forgot to include playback, to the Hollywood movie star, [Hedy Lamarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr), who helped invent the technology behind Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

This year, I decided to re-start and re-read [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) and bought both the physical copy and the digital version to read wherever I want to.

I'm beginning to read books about parenting teenagers and grown-up kids. In my own attempt for preparedness, I read a good book, [Prepared: What Kids Need for a Fulfilled Life](https://www.amazon.com/Prepared-What-Kids-Need-Fulfilled/dp/1984826069) by Diane Tavenner. Be warned that this book is very American-School and community specific, so you have to read it and get the best ideas out of it and not try to compare/contrast to find similarities and differences.

[Project Hail Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary) is a science fiction novel by [Andy Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Weir). It is his third novel, after [The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)), and [Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_(novel)). A scientific mystery, spiced up with an interstellar journey, the novel is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival of the protagonist in the story, Ryland Grace.

# Q

Quote a lot of introverts suggested reading the book, [Quiet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet%3A_The_Power_of_Introverts_in_a_World_That_Can't_Stop_Talking): The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain. However, having read many other books in similar tone, I wasn't too impressed by the content and I had to do quick flybys in quite a few section of the book. It kinda sounded repetitive with many other non-fiction self-help books. If you are an introvert, and want to be in leadership positions, you will like the book but also will likely just node-along and that was that for me.

One day I told my daughter that I noticed her reading a lot less. She said, she is no more into kid books and wants to try the likes of -- [The Art of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War). So, I dropped my Kindle copy to hers and bought the Hardcover version too. I re-read The Art of War and it was fun to read it again.

In [The Code Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_Breaker), [Walter Isaacson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Isaacson) goes deep and technical to talk about [Jennifer Doudna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Doudna), a biochemist who has done pioneering work in CRISPR gene editing, received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with [Emmanuelle Charpentier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuelle_Charpentier), "for the development of a method for genome editing." This is another of Walter's massive books with rather long winding life-stories of scientists, students, post-doctoral candidates, engineers, and and many others in the book. This is going to be a very long read, and can stay on the stand/shelf for a very long time without the need to finish it off at one-go.

In [The Creativity Code](https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Code-Learning-Write-Paint-dp-0008288151/dp/0008288151/), [Marcus du Sautoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_du_Sautoy), a Mathematician and author, toys with the idea of a future where machine learning will disrupt, enrich, and transform our understanding of what it means to be creative. The book is for creatives, and lovers of science without necessarily the need to be good at complex mathematics. The author smoothens the mathematics involved for the common man.

I'm surprised with the popularity and suggestions to read the [The Future We Choose](https://www.amazon.com/Future-We-Choose-Surviving-Climate/dp/0525658351). I find it pretty bland, and its effort to make it `interesting` with a story-telling effort falls flat for me. I was expecting a more tangible and hard-hitting facts, and figures to take home but I felt like I'm just re-reading what I'm dealing with in my day-to-day work.

[Will](https://willthebook.com) is a memoir by [Will Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith). You will love it if you are still a fan of Will Smith. He is an awesome actor and loved most of his movies. Personally, I was unable to bring myself to love his book. This is indeed a good book but personally, a hard-read for me. Perhaps, a dramatized movie would be nicer where one can just spend a few hours and finish it off. You should still read it once.

I'm trying to organize and pre-planned books to be read in a year, with room for additions and changes. A set of books I can see regularly helps me focus quickly on the books I want to read, reading them slowly and deeply instead of just reading a lot.

Every year, I try to re-read one or more of the [best books](/books/) I have ever read.
