# Apple Polishing Cloth

Apple released its [Polishing Cloth](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth) in October of 2021. It is a one-of-a-kind microfiber cloth, best earmarked for cleaning Apple hardware and devices.

> Made with soft, nonabrasive material, the Polishing Cloth cleans any Apple display, including nano-texture glass, safely and effectively.

It replaces the cloth that ships with Apple's monitors, such as the Pro Display XDR. It is the only cloth Apple customers are instructed to clean the "nano-texture glass" with.

Apple's pricing did shake the Apple fanverse with its costlier than usual pricing, at $19 (₹1,900 in India) for each piece. Nonetheless, it turned out to be one of the most successful launches in recent years -- it was back-ordered by months.

The polishing cloth feels extra premium, and you can feel the proverbial heaven while cleaning Apple devices. It caresses the glasses with such smoothness that it touches like a diamond on glass, sans the cut.

But beware, the product page lists every devices the polishing cloth is compatible with. For instance, it is only compatible with the first-generation iPhone SE, the first-generation iPad mini, and the fifth-generation iPod touch. The polishing cloth can indeed be used to clean with non-Apple devices.

The cloth comes embossed with the Apple logo. It’s subtle, but it is there. It’s placed in the lower right corner, so it stays out of the way but still reminds you it’s Apple’s premium cloth.

Is it worth it? Well, it depends. It turned out to be a thing-of-awe for me, to buy and keep it -- perhaps frame it -- so I can smile, laugh, or maybe even cry with joy in the future, remembering the product do exist, and I own a piece.

To compensate for the guilt, I had been skipping lunch every Saturday ever since I bought the Apple Polishing Cloth.
