# Get your Joost Invites today

I've invited all those who commented on my <a href="/2007/joost/">Joost Invite</a> article. As Joost is giving out unlimited invites before their launch, I'd be able to invite all of you. So, if you haven't got your <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> yet, comment here or anywhere else and I'll send an invite over to you.

Joost is a new way of watching TV on the internet, which uses new and established technologies to provide the best of both the internet and TV worlds - with programs, channels and adverts. Joost uses secure peer-to-peer technology to stream programs to your computer. Unlike other TV and video-based web applications, it does not require users to download any files to their computers or browse through complicated websites.

If you miss the invitation, let me know, I'll be reading the comments - each one of them. You don't have to explicitly type your email in the comment, just fill up the e-mail form field, so I can invite you without your email being shown naked to email leechers and spammers.

If you got your invite, please continue to invite others or (optionally) write a THANK YOU article linking to this article so people will know where to ask for a Joost invites.
