<p><a href="http://www.joost.com/" title="Joost&trade;"></a>I've invited all those who commented on my <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/2007/joost/">Joost Invite</a> article. As Joost is giving out unlimited invites before their launch, I'd be able to invite all of you. So, if you haven't got your <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> yet, comment here or anywhere else and I'll send an invite over to you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> is a new way of watching TV on the internet, which uses new and established technologies to provide the best of both the internet and TV worlds - with programs, channels and adverts. Joost uses secure peer-to-peer technology to stream programs to your computer. Unlike other TV and video-based web applications, it does not require users to download any files to their computers or browse through complicated websites.</p>

<p><strong>If you miss the invitation</strong>, let me know, I'll be reading the comments - each one of them. You don't have to explicitly type your email in the comment, just fill up the e-mail form field, so I can invite you without your email being shown naked to email leechers and spammers.</p>
<p>If you got your invite, please continue to invite others or (optionally) write a THANK YOU article linking to this article so people will know where to ask for a Joost invites.</p>
<p>Btw, I'm sorry that I could not muster enough time to write your proper First and Last Name in the Invites, I just have to make sure your emails were right!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATES</strong></p>
<p><strong>2007 3rd May</strong>:<br />
Finished inviting a little over 150 people to <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>2007 4th May</strong>:<br />
I think I must have invited another 100+ today. Btw, the comments, and emails are overwhelming and is thus slowing down my invite. But I will definitely make it a point to invite everyone who commented here. If you are not invited within 24 hours of your comments, either comment again or <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2007 5th May</strong>:<br />
Completed another batch of invites, must have been about 100 odd invites.</p>
<p><strong>2007 8th May</strong>:<br />
Joost is <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/05/07/joost-heavy/">adding content providers</a> at a staggering rate. There was Viacom and CBS, then the indie crowd, and now a slightly smaller - but still significant - popular video site <a href="http://www.heavy.com/">Heavy</a>. Heavy will provide programming to Joost from a selection of its brands: Heavy Animation, Heavy Comedy and Heavy Gurls.</p>
<p><strong>2007 13th May</strong>:<br />
I've invited whoever have commented or contacted me (I'm sorry for the delays) so far (must have been over 900+ invites). <span class="codered">However, I'll no longer be able to invite those who do not have a proper email and have used emails specially for Joost, or redirects like invitemetoJoost@redirectnospam.com.</span></p>
