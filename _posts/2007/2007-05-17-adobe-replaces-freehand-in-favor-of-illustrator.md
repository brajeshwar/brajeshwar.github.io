Adobe has <a href="http://www.jnack.com/adobe/illustrator/FreeHand_to_Illustrator_Migration_FAQ.pdf">created an FAQ</a> (PDF) that explains the details of the decision not to rev FreeHand, talks about <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/">Illustrator CS3</a> features added to make FreeHand users more comfortable, and more.</p>
<p><strong>FreeHand Upgrade Path</strong><br />
A special upgrade to Illustrator CS3 is available to all registered owners of FreeHand for $199 U.S. This upgrade is available worldwide through the Adobe Store and through the Channel. There is no direct FreeHand to Creative Suite 3 upgrade, but FreeHand owners who also own Adobe or Macromedia products that are eligible for upgrade to the Suite can use that path to move to the Suite.</p>
