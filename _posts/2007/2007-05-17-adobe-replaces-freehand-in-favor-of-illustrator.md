# Adobe replaces FreeHand in favor of Illustrator

<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/">John Nack</a>, Senior Product Manager, Adobe Photoshop wrote that Adobe will be <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2007/05/freehand_no_lon.html">replacing Freehand with Illustrator</a>. Adobe will continue to sell the current version of FreeHand, but will not do any further development and won't release any updates.

Adobe has <a href="http://www.jnack.com/adobe/illustrator/FreeHand_to_Illustrator_Migration_FAQ.pdf">created an FAQ</a> (PDF) that explains the details of the decision not to rev FreeHand, talks about <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/">Illustrator CS3</a> features added to make FreeHand users more comfortable, and more.

## FreeHand Upgrade Path

A special upgrade to Illustrator CS3 is available to all registered owners of FreeHand for $199 U.S. This upgrade is available worldwide through the Adobe Store and through the Channel. There is no direct FreeHand to Creative Suite 3 upgrade, but FreeHand owners who also own Adobe or Macromedia products that are eligible for upgrade to the Suite can use that path to move to the Suite.
