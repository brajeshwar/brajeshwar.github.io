excerpt: We have seen Rumors and Suggestions galore across the Internet space on how
  and why Microsoft and Yahoo! should join forces to fight the overwhelming success
  of Google. Although, Microsoft and Yahoo! are very unlikely to join hands anytime
  soon, they are doing their bit on their own to be able to compete with Google and
  fare well in the game - particularly search and advertisement. Microsoft's purchase
  of aQuantive is in direct response to the recent acquisition of DoubleClick by Google.

<p><img src="/static/2007/05/microsoft-windows.jpg" alt="Microsoft" style="border: 0 none;" />In what's termed to be a direct response to <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/2007/google-acquires-doubleclick-for-31-billion/">Google's acquisition of DoubleClick</a> for $3.1 billion, <strong>Microsoft's purchase of aQuantive for $6 billion</strong> is coined by industry experts as a very smart move.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/05/18/microsoft-to-buy-aquantive-for-6b-at-high-cost-to-stay-in-game/">Microsoft-aQuantive deal</a>, which is the largest deal in the advertising industry, is indeed a desparate attempt to match Google's advertising muscle and perhaps to recoup their failure in their earlier multi-million dollar bid for DoubleClick. Microsoft offered $66.50 per share for <a href="http://www.aquantive.com/">aQuantive</a>, an 85% premium to its closing price on Thursday.<br />
<br />
Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platform and services division, said: "It is a big bet on advertising monetisation for the long-term growth of the company and this is a significant step forward." He said the online advertising market would be worth $40bn this year and was growing at 20 per cent a year. - MSNBC</p>
<p>aQuantive, of Seattle, has about 2,600 employees, and reported 2006 profit of $54 million on sales of $442.2 million. aQuantive brings Microsoft technology and services, but not the much needed half a million advertisers and traffic network to Microsoft. - <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/05/18/microsoft-to-buy-aquantive-for-6b-at-high-cost-to-stay-in-game/">VentureBeat</a></p>

<p><em>The Internet's high-stakes advertising derby shifted into overdrive during the past month as four of the industry's behind-the-scenes players (Google Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. - and WPP Group PLC) agreed to takeovers. The deals' combined price totaled $10.4 billion, exceeding the total amount of money spent on Internet ads just three years ago. <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news98775785.html">Read the article</a> in Details.</em></p>
