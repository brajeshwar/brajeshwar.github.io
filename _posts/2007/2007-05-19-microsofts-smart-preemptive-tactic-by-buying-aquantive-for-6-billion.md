title: Microsoft's smart preemptive tactic by buying aQuantive for $6 billion
---

In what's termed to be a direct response to <a href="/2007/google-acquires-doubleclick-for-31-billion/">Google's acquisition of DoubleClick</a> for $3.1 billion, Microsoft's purchase of aQuantive for $6 billion is coined by industry experts as a very smart move.

The <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/05/18/microsoft-to-buy-aquantive-for-6b-at-high-cost-to-stay-in-game/">Microsoft-aQuantive deal</a>, which is the largest deal in the advertising industry, is indeed a desparate attempt to match Google's advertising muscle and perhaps to recoup their failure in their earlier multi-million dollar bid for DoubleClick. Microsoft offered $66.50 per share for <a href="http://www.aquantive.com/">aQuantive</a>, an 85% premium to its closing price on Thursday.

Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platform and services division, said: "It is a big bet on advertising monetisation for the long-term growth of the company and this is a significant step forward." He said the online advertising market would be worth $40bn this year and was growing at 20 per cent a year. - MSNBC

aQuantive, of Seattle, has about 2,600 employees, and reported 2006 profit of $54 million on sales of $442.2 million. aQuantive brings Microsoft technology and services, but not the much needed half a million advertisers and traffic network to Microsoft. - <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/05/18/microsoft-to-buy-aquantive-for-6b-at-high-cost-to-stay-in-game/">VentureBeat</a>
