excerpt: My own site have been a victim for quite sometime and it had even driven
  me to think over and over again if I should move out. The site encounters 500 error
  every time I try to approve/moderate a comment and when I try to post an article.

<p>I've been very happy and satisfied with the hosting at "MediaTemple (MediaTemple)":http://mediatemple.net/. They are one of the best web hosting providers around and with their recent introduction of "Grid Server (MediaTemple did it again - Grid Server released)":/2006/mediatemple-did-it-again-gs-grid-server-released/, they have introduced many good features and more juices to your hosting needs.</p>
<p>However, they've been erratic of late with their "Urchin Statistics (Missing Urchin Stats)":http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/2006/11/30/missing-urcin-stats-for-1127-to-1128/ and their MySQL Database being unable to keep up with the query demands.</p>

<p>My own site have been a victim for quite sometime and it had even driven me to think over and over again if I should move out. The site encounters 500 error every time I try to approve/moderate a comment and when I try to post an article. However, the comments and articles goes though but this is frustrating and irritating. The problem started  when I was still using Movable Type and it continues to do so with Wordpress. So, it is their server and not the CMS I am using. My request to them have faced lukewarm response and the problem with the stats and mysql continues. I've always suggested MediaTemple for any serious and Creme hosting but I don't think I will be doing that anymore.</p>
<p>I even looked at some other sites hosted on the MediaTemple Grid server and they seem to face the same problem. Here are some screenshots that happens every time I try to post an article --</p>
<p>* "500 error on brajeshwar.com (500 error on brajeshwar.com)":http://media.brajeshwar.com/i/misc/mt-error-500.jpg<br />
* "500 error (500 error on whoisdeep.com)":http://media.brajeshwar.com/i/misc/mt-error-500-whoisdeep.jpg when I try to comment on another Wordpress Powered blog hosted at MediaTemple</p>
<p><strong>So, what do you think?</strong></p>
<p>* Is MediaTemple no longer that good anymore?<br />
* Is Mediatemple unable to keep up the promise they made?</p>
<p>What is your experience with MediaTemple?</p>
