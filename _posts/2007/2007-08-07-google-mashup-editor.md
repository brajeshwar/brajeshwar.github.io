excerpt: The Google Mashup Editor is an incredibly powerful tool for rapid testing
  and deployment of mashup concepts, particularly those that utilize Google services
  or products. It's simple, easy and fun to produce something very quickly, but it
  will be much harder to produce fantastic products.
