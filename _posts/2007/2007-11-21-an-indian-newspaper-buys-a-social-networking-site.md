excerpt: Indians are accessing the Internet for everything from movie reviews to information
  gathering, giving companies that are getting into this space - a reason or niche
  for themselves to exist. This is the prime time for the burst of the Internet age
  in India.

<p>Few hours back, Mint <a href="http://www.livemint.com/2007/11/21001018/HT-Media8217s-net-arm-buys.html">reported</a> that Firefly eVentures Ltd, a wholly owned Internet subsidiary of Hindustan Times Media Ltd., has acquired social networking site - <a href="http://www.desimartini.com/">DesiMartini</a>. Terms and exact price were not disclosed but is believed to be less than $10 million.</p>
<p><br />
"Everything is becoming localized and as broadband penetration improves, we see phenomenal opportunity and growth in the Internet in India. This acquisition in the social networking space is the first step towards expanding our Internet base. We are exploring other new online businesses such as gaming, e-commerce and classifieds," said Amit Garg, business head, internet, HT Media.</p>

<p>Apart from global social networking sites such as Google Inc.'s <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.desimartini.com/">Desimartini</a> competes with homegrown players such as the Bangalore-based <a href="http://www.minglebox.com/">Minglebox</a>, <a href="http://www.ibibo.com/">Ibibo</a>, <a href="http://www.indyarocks.com/">Indyarocks</a> and <a href="http://www.bigadda.com/">Bigadda</a>, a site launched by Reliance Entertainment, part of the Reliance Anil Dhirubai Ambani Group.</p>
