excerpt: Already a broadly adopted industry standard, the inclusion of the H.264 codec
  in Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR, the Creative Suite product line, and the upcoming
  Adobe Media Player will accelerate customer workflows, enabling the creation and
  repurpose of high-quality Web video content without extra development costs.
