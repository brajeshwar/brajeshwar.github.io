excerpt: There is a plethora of shopping sites, a few of them good while others are
  failing to deliver. A client tipped me about an upcoming site that's about to launch
  their beta site soon. The site, TestFreaks, will be aggregating a bunch information
  such as, professional reviews, user reviews, forums, blogs and prices.

<p><img src="/static/2007/09/nikon-d40x.jpg" alt="Nikon D40x" style="border: 0 none; border-bottom: 1px solid #999; padding-bottom: 0;" />I was looking for reviews, price list, comparisons while I was planning to buy my first DSLR. I settled for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/sets/72157601670676470/" title="Nikon D40x">Nikon D40x</a> as it came under my budget and I think I made a good choice for an entry level, hobby photography DSLR.</p>
<p>During my planning process, co-incidentally, a client of mine emailed me about <a href="http://www.testfreaks.com/" title="TestFreaks">TestFreaks</a>, a new aggregator kinda sites that pulls in reviews, test, etc from blogs, forums and news sites. I won't say the site is one stop point for all your reviews reading but it does prove to be a good starting point. They are expected to start their private beta soon, <a href="http://www.testfreaks.com/" title="sign-up">sign-up</a> if you wish to be invited.</p>

From the founders of PriceRunner, TestFreaks is VC funded by <a href="http://www.northzone.com/" title="NorthZone Ventures">NorthZone Ventures</a>. The site will be aggregating a bunch information such as, professional reviews, user reviews, forums, blogs and prices. Currently, they are starting off with - <a href="http://www.testfreaks.com/digital-cameras/" title="digital cameras">digital cameras</a>, <a href="http://www.testfreaks.com/cell-phones/" title="cell phones">cell phones</a>, <a href="http://www.testfreaks.com/mp3-players/" title="mp3 players">mp3 players</a> etc.</p>
<p>Let's hope that TestFreaks proves to be a good site and can help consumers find better products at the best price possible. I hope they will not be biased and can collect an enormous amount of information and organize them effectively for easy access by consumers. They're currently looking for more Beta Testers; so sign-up at <a href="http://www.testfreaks.com/" title="TestFreaks">TestFreaks</a>.</p>
<p>Btw, are you a beginner, amateur photographer? Have you had that feeling of hesitating asking questions at the numerous forums associated with professional because your question will look stupid? Well, I felt the same many a times and thus with some like minded newbie photographers, I've started an Easy & Simple Amateur Photography Forum. Come, join and ask what you've always wanted to ask all about photography.</p>
