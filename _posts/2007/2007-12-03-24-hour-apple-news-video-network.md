  rumors, and lifestyle. iMac, iPod, and now iPhone. The names have become synonymous
  with pop culture in the 21st century.

<p>The <a href="http://www.thedigitallifestyle.tv/">Digital Lifestyle</a> launched a new 24-hour online network dedicated to Apple followers. The site mixes original programs with popular Apple/tech-related podcasts and YouTube material, as well as daily news updates and live coverage of breaking tech news events.<br />
<br />
iMac, iPod, and now iPhone. The names have become synonymous with pop culture in the 21st century. And they all belong to one company: <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>. Apple products are pushing and refining what we call the digital lifestyle. From music, to movies, to communications, for better or worse, Apple is the trendsetter for the tech industry.</p>
<p>Using live video technology from Mogulus, viewers can watch live broadcasts and participate by submitting their own video segments. Original shows include "Root Access," a weekly live tech help show with a former Apple "Mac Genius" and "Gary's Garage," offering a look at Apple and other company's products of the past.</p>
