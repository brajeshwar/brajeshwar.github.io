title: Adobe Flash Player 9 for Linux Released
---

Adobe today announced the availability of Flash Player 9 for Linux. Senior Product Manager at Adobe, [Emmy Huang](http://weblogs.macromedia.com/emmy/), says -- "With the proliferation of video on the Web, Adobe Flash Player is quickly becoming the de facto industry standard for delivering engaging interactive content and applications. Now the Linux community has full access to the high volume of Flash content and applications available on the Internet today, bringing Linux developers and users to the forefront of the Web 2.0 experience."

It may be noted that Flash Developers using Linux can thus create, test and deploy Rich Internet Flash Applications using the Free Flex 2 Software Developers Kit and the Free Flex Data Services 2 Express.

Adobe Flash Player 9 for Linux vastly enhances user experiences with new capabilities such as efficient memory utilization, advanced features for graphics, video and text, as well as the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM2), which allows up to 10 times faster scripting performance. Adobe recently contributed source code from the AVM2 to the Mozilla Foundation, which is hosting a new open source project called [Tamarin](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/) to accelerate the development of a standards-based approach for creating rich and engaging Web applications that work across multiple platforms.
