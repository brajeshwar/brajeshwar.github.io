Thanks to Peter Elst for the Joost invitation. I would like to extend the goodwill by giving out the invites I have currently. 

<a href="https://joost.com/">Joost</a> is a new way of watching TV on the internet, which uses new and established technologies to provide the best of both the internet and TV worlds - with programs, channels and adverts. Joost uses secure peer-to-peer technology to stream programs to your computer. Unlike other TV and video-based web applications, it does not require users to download any files to their computers or browse through complicated websites.
