<p>I was searching around for Adobe Products specially Flash Network on the "Feedburner (Feedburner)":http://www.feedburner.com/ Ad Network; unable to find one, I decided to create them. In fact, I created 3 Feedburner Networks - "Adobe Products (Adobe Products)":http://networks.feedburner.com/AdobeProducts, "Flash Designers & Developers (Flash Designers & Developers)":http://networks.feedburner.com/FlashDesDev and "Apple Products (Apple Products)":http://networks.feedburner.com/AppleProducts.</p>
<p>Well you cannot just go about creating Feedburner Network without you being invited/accepted into a Network. So, here is what I am going to do. I'll be inviting few people I know who uses Adobe Products, Flash and also Apple Products. I'll also be accepting request for invitation for few users who have a good number of Feed Subscribers. If you think you're one and I should invite you, please use the comment or "contact (contact)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/contact/ me directly. Remember to include your desired Feedburner Network.</p>

<p>*What are FeedBurner Networks?*</p>
<p>FeedBurner Networks is a service (currently in beta), that encourages discoverability and self-promotion of your feed content.</p>
<p>*Who needs this service and why?*</p>
<p>This service benefits publishers, subscribers and even advertisers by increasing discoverability of feed-driven content. Publishers benefit by banding together to increase exposure and take advantage of cross-promotional opportunities. Subscribers benefit by finding more content that interests them and advertisers benefit with increased targeting capability and exposure to content that may have been difficult to otherwise find.</p>
