excerpt: Looks like the MySpace-PhotoBucket fight was just a foreplay storm for the
  lull, calm climax that was coming! They are now together, PhotoBucket goes to MySpace.

<p>Wasn't it last month that <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> blocked <a href="http://www.photobucket.com/">PhotoBucket</a> for infringement of the Terms of Use - <a href="http://gigaom.com/2007/04/12/photobucket-ceo-our-videos-dont-have-ads/">Photobucket CEO: Our videos don&rsquo;t have ads</a>?<br />
<br />
Well, that seems to be a foreplay storm for the calm climax coming in - <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/exclusive/photobucket-goes-to-myspace-258222.php">MySpace acquires PhotoBucket</a>.<br />
<br />
Om Malik's deduction on why MySpace bought PhotoBucket is that the MySpace photo service hasn't really gained as much traction and MySpace users continue to gravitate towards Photobucket. According to Hitwise, "Photobucket <a href="http://weblogs.hitwise.com/leeann-prescott/2007/04/photobucket_myspace.html">accounted for 73% of Photography category</a> visits leaving MySpace and Photobucket is by far the most dominant photo website for MySpace users."</p>
<p>He further adds that, it could be one Happy Monday for Photobucket's investors - Trinity Ventures and Insight Venture Partners. Their good fortune would mean that other Silicon Valley moneybags would be willing to take riskier bets on start-ups that have high traffic, but little in terms of revenues, profits.</p>
<p>Photobucket was founded in 2003 by Alex Welch and Darren Crystal; it took off in 2005 as users on social network sites such as Myspace began to use the service to store and display pictures of themselves and their friends.</p>
<p>The figures are sketchy but Photobucket, and its bankers Lehman Brothers, were looking for at least $300 million. Well, looks like all other widget maker companies that leech on social networking sites like MySpace can take a breather as there is different mode of revenue in the making. Best wishes to all Widgets!</p>
