excerpt: Pownce is a way to send messages, files, links, and events to your friends.
  You'll create a network of the people you know  and then you can share stuff with
  all of them, just a few of them, or even just one other person really fast.

<p><img src="/static/2007/07/pownce.gif" alt="Pownce" style="border: 0 none;" />Alright, alright, I wasn't taking it that seriously but yes, I got Pownce Invites to give out too. <a href="http://pownce.com/">Pownce</a> is another service like Twitter combined with file sharing and chat. However, the attention it seeks from the community is largely because of the Digg-guy Kevin who started it as <a href="http://kevinrose.com/post/4403240">a fun project</a>.</p>
<p>I'm yet to enjoy it to its fullest; just got the invite yesterday from a good smart kid - <a href="http://www.rishiraj.info/">Rishiraj</a>. It has a Pro version and the only attractive feature there is the badge of which I haven't subscribed yet.</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
Pownce has an Adobe AIR desktop based version. It is just a simple interface for Pownce and it gives you only a small fraction of its features. Pownce do not even have a designated logo but just text saying "Pownce". Perhaps, it is true that it is just Kevin's weekend project.</p>
<p>So, without much talk, I have the first batch of 6 invites and it is open for the general public for those who can take the pain to <strong>comment on this article</strong>. By the way, I have crossed <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/2007/joost/">2000+ for the Joost invites</a> and I still have a huge list of invites that got piled up during my extended vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to put your email in the body of the comment, just use your proper email in the <em>email field</em>. I manually send out the invites and thus I know what your email is from the commenting system of my blog. And here is my Pownce Profile.</p>
<p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p>
<p>* Mashable is also giving <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/06/28/pownce-2/">Pownce Invites</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATES</strong></p>
<p><strong>2007, 1st August:</strong> I've invited all those who have commented with a valid email ID. Pownce do not accept Spambox mail ID, so they're not invited. Moreover, your email is not public so use a valid email ID if you wish to get an Invite.</p>
