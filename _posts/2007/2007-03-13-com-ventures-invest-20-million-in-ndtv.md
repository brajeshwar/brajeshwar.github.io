India's biggest news broadcaster by sales, New Delhi Television Ltd, has signed an agreement with Com Ventures to draw funds to the Company's media operations in UK. Com Ventures will invest $20 million in <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/">NDTV</a>, the broadcaster said in a regulatory filling with the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday. NDTV runs two English Television channels and a Hindi channel in India.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/175469951/">Keyur Patel</a> is one of the most energetic, smart, ultra sophisticated but utterly humble business man I've ever met. Even on that meeting, after his long day's ordeal, he was still oozing with energy to blast me with ideas, business intricacies and life's simple solutions for almost 3 hours. I returned home more energized, packed with couple of more ideas and an elevated thinking that I was missing for quite sometime. I hope, I will continue to learn and be enlightened as much as he imparts the good things to me.</p>
