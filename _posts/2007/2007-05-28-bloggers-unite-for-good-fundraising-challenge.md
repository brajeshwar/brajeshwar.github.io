excerpt: The goal is to raise $25,000 for schools around the country, many of which
  are in New Orleans. The hope is to blow this goal away and raise far more money.
  If bloggers can do this, it will set a precedent that will enable the blogging community
  to do a bunch of good for other causes in the future.
