# Bloggers unite for Good Fundraising Challenge

This Monday, May 28th, 2007 join thousands of bloggers and use your blog to benefit <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=16793">DonorsChoose</a>, a non-profit Web site that brings teachers and donors together to fund specific student projects that range from "Magical Math Centers" to "Cooking Across the Curriculum". Join the blogging community and use your blog to draw attention to and raise funds for this underserved non-profit organization that does so much good for children and schools. 

Of course, you can donate if you feel the urge. The goal is to raise $25,000 for schools around the country, many of which are in New Orleans. The hope is to blow this goal away and raise far more money. If bloggers can do this, it will set a precedent that will enable the blogging community to do a bunch of good for other causes in the future.
