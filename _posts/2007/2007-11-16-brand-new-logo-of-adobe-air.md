# Brand new Logo of Adobe AIR

Mike Chambers <a href="http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2007/11/15/introducing-the-adobe-air-logo/">posted an article</a> introducing the brand new <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/air">Adobe AIR</a> Logo.

The latest design is supposedly the Final Logo. It may be noted that Adobe AIR has been pretty inconsistent as far as branding goes. It has had a number of logos and graphics associated with it, including the rocket-ship, and the current "AIR" branding.

Mike Chambers explains, "Part of this was due to the surprisingly complex process of designing and settling on a logo in the technology world. There have been quite a few times during the past year where we felt that we were close to having the final logo, only to then find out that it was just a bit too familiar to some other logo in the computer / internet / tech world."

The Logo represents the three core Adobe web technologies - HTML, Flash and PDF. Each corner of the logo represents one of these core technologies.
