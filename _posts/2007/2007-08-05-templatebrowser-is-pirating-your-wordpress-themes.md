title: TemplateBrowser is pirating your Wordpress Themes
---

Few days back, I read <a href="http://5thirtyone.com/archives/837">5thirtyOne</a> reporting about `TemplateBrowser` re-distributing Wordpress Themes (and Joomla Templates) and adding malware links. Templates Browser have modified the public blog themes in such a way as to exploit the end user by inserting hidden spam or malware links and removing the Author credits.

Today, I saw <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/08/04/warning-templatebrowser-dot-com/">Weblog Tools Collections</a> warning us about the same and decided to check it out if my themes are there too.

In fact, most of the popular Wordpress Themes are listed there. Well, I found my Wordpress Theme a victim too.
