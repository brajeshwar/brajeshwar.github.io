title: Pacman add-on for Firefox
---

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2053">Pacman add-on for Firefox</a> is a Pacman-clone and has the ascii look and feel of the old golden days. With good retro graphics, nice sound effects and a highscore list, this is one nice relaxer from your browsing routine.

Once installed, restart Firefox and get it from `Tools > Pacman`. Press either the `UP` or the `DOWN` arrow to start the game.

There are 4 different speed settings that work as difficulty levels: slow, normal, fast and insane.
