In a recent acquisition, Technicolor took over Paprikaas, the Bangalore-based animation and video game company. Technicolor's deal with DreamWorks will draw on local animators and technicians for upcoming film and television projects. Technicolor has a 100,000 sq ft site in Bangalore where its employees work on film restoration, digital compression and authoring for Blu-ray and HD-DVD releases, as well as visual effects for new films.</p>
<p>Ahmad Ouri, president of Technicolor content services, said the group was keen to expand its visual effects work.</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to create a real centre of excellence for digital services in India.</p></blockquote>
<p>DreamWorks Animation wanted to "tap into and further develop the gifted talent base in India".</p>
<p><strong>Footnote:</strong><br />
<em>Here is something I know about the features and additional contents that you get from your DVDs. There are few Bangalore firms that does subtitle (more popularly known as Visual Text for the Hearing Impaired in USA) for Movie DVDs - both old and new movies. Go figure, why we (Indians) are more comfortable with the subtitles ON while watching Hollywood Movies on DVD. Oh! Did I tell you that it is fun at times when the subtitles goes wrong and don't print what the characters are speaking.</em></p>
