<p>Java have long failed to woo Internet users on the client front-end. Flash was ruling it for years; but wit the recent announcement of <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/2007/microsoft-plans-to-topple-flash/">SilverLight</a> from Microsoft, Sun could no longer stay behind. So, they are trying again with a consumer-flavored Java - JavaFX.</p>
<p>JavaFX is said to be a new scripting variant of Java with a focus on development for the consumer communications market, including desktops, mobile clients, and TVs. The first product release is JavaFX Mobile, a software system for mobile devices.</p>

<p>The object-oriented applications programming language that is Java was once the cool kid on the block, a base from which a new generation of applications would be launched, taking over our desktops. And yet it never happened. The new product, with its focus on mobile technology presents the potential of dealing Sun back into the application game <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/08/sun-responds-to-ajax-silverlight-with-javafx/">in a big way</a> if it's well received today by developers.</p>
<p>JavaFX Script centers on content creation and leverages the high-volume distribution of Java. "JavaFX Script is a scripting language focused on the content-authoring and content creation crowd. It is a means of creating visually impactful, high-performance, dramatic Web and network-facing artifacts or experiences that run all the way from the desktop running Java SE (Standard Edition) all the way down to mobile devices powered by JavaFX Mobile." JavaFX, which will be open sourced, leverages 2D graphics APIs in the Swing GUI toolkit.</p>
<p>Sun is confident, "There are already 5 million programmers who work with Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) for building Java programs on desktops, according to Sun. A shrinked-down version of Java, called Java Platform, Mobile Edition (Java ME), is already installed on 2 billion phones worldwide."</p>
