excerpt: Unlike these other companies, Fabrik has expanded into hardware. Last February,
  they dropped $43M to buy SimpleTech, a major provider of external storage devices,
  (hard-drives, USB flash drives, etc). Until then, it had partnered with Seagate
  (makers of Maxtor).

<p>VentureBeat <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/05/17/fabrik-raises-249m-more-for-file-storage-and-sharing/">reports</a> of a good news about Fabrik, a company that offer online storage and easy sharing of big files. <a href="http://www.myfabrik.com/">Fabrik</a> has just closed a $24.9 million deal and added Ross Levinsohn, former President of Fox Interactive Media, to the board. Its financing came primarily from <a href="">3i</a>, with a small chunk from <a href="http://www.comventures.com/">ComVentures</a>.<br />
<br />
Ross Levinsohn, spearheaded News Corporation's plunge into the online world, overseeing, among other things, the development of <a href="http://www.fox.com/">Fox</a> and the acquisition of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>. VentureBeat went on to speculate that his joining the board is indicative of Fabrik's intention to push past the small business market and target consumers.</p>
<p>Fabrik's intention is to be the self-described &ldquo;Apple of storage,&rdquo; offering a line of hardware and software products whose components work best when used together. A highly placed source from inside Fabrik told me that they have a subscription figure of about <strong>1 million devices per qaurter</strong>. It is also learnt that Fabrik was profitable before the infusion, but that it will allow them to expand their international efforts and diversify their offerings. </p>
