<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativesuite/"><img src="/static/2007/04/adobe-cs3.jpg" alt="Adobe Creative Suite 3" style="border: 0 none;" /></a>Adobe Creative Suite 3 will be launched in India with a special event at Mumbai. The event will be on Thursday, April 19, 2007 at 08:30 am in the morning at Hyatt Regency, Sahar, Mumbai. The venue/hotel is located near the International Airport in Andheri (E).</p>
<p>The Agenda starts at 08:30 am starting with Registration and will last till the end of the day at 05:45 pm. After the tea break starting 11:45 am till 12:00, there is an "Apple Keynote". I am suspecting that it should be Apple Mac's geared agenda for Adobe Creative Suite 3.</p>
