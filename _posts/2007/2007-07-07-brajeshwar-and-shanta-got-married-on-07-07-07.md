title: Brajeshwar and Shanta got married on 07-07-07
---

I was actually thinking of 11-11-11 as the cool date to get married. However, things don't always happen the way you want, you have to twist things happening around you to make it work for you in the better way. So, today, on this cool numbered date [07-07-07](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/747310966/), Shanta and I got officially married.

### The Wedding

Due to the overwhelming interest from our parents, gurdians and relatives, the whole plan was super advanced and everything started to fall into places, dates and calendared events. It all started with a family-only miniature Engagement held at a local Temple in Mumbai (INDIA) on the Feb 26, 2007. Then, according to local well-wishers, pundits and sanskrit scholars, our wedding date was fixed on Jun 20, 2007. It was later learnt that more than 5,000 marriages happened that day in Imphal, Manipur (INDIA).

Well, we got married in front of over 500 visitors, relatives and family members. That made the people from home happy as we hit the right dates and heed to their likes, advises and wishes.

### Shanta

Ever since I was in 10th grade, I knew Shanta as the youngest, naughtiest, the most talkative and of course the funniest, sister of one of my friend. Never had I in my mind thought she will be my girlfriend or more strangely my wife. I would ask her to make me good tea whenever I visited their home and even remember lecturing her to study well, sometimes getting down to teaching a bit of Maths, Physics here and there.

She was also one of most out-going and well-connected girl, who loves to ride around the town's nook and corner on her bike almost everyday. I saw her, bump on her at most known places - restaurants, ice-cream parlors, soft-drink joints - and cinema houses. That easy access to her made her an ideal cupid for my erstwhile girlfriends. She would happily went in and bring out my girlfriends so I can have my dates.

After I finished high school, there was no connection with my friend and thus never saw her again until early last year (2006) when I was looking for new recruits for the QA team at Mixercast. Co-incidentally, she was looking for a change of job and her brother got in touch with me through [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/). Shanta got employed with Mixercast and my interaction with her started afresh but things were different this time.

Her hair has grown long and she was more lady-like, of which I was extremely surprised. She had shed her typical trademarked short-pants and she looked more matured in her new attire, dresses and accessories. I honestly do not have a clue when everything started but we remember talking to her mother about marriage dates, plans for engagements, and ceremonial events.

Well, that's it, we got married.
