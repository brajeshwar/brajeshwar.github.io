title: Essential Principles for Good Web Design
---

I just stumbled on an awesome article from <a href="http://psdtuts.com/">PSDTuts</a> - <a href="http://psdtuts.com/designing-tutorials/9-essential-principles-for-good-web-design/">9 Essential Principles for Good Web Design</a>. In the article, <strong>Collis</strong> talks about the oxymorons that a designer faces while designing a good website - a design that is both usable and pleasing, delivers information and builds brand, is technically sound and visually coherent.

The article is worth a read, and it links to other resources which are old but golden rules of the design paradigm. The article lays out 9 Essential Principles for Good Web Design;

- Precedence (Guiding the Eye)
- Spacing
- Navigation
- Design to Build
- Typography
- Usability
- Alignment
- Clarity (Sharpness)
- Consistency
