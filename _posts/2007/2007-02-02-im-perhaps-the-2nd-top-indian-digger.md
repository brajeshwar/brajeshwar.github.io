# I'm perhaps the 2nd Top Indian Digger

I was talking to a friend, [Smaran Dayal](http://smarandayal.com/) who is the only Indian Digger on the Top 15 listing on [Digg](http://www.digg.com/). I took a [final look at the Top listing](http://blog.digg.com/?p=60) in the top 100 Diggers and we came to the conclusion that there are no other from India. So, we concluded that I'm the [2nd Top Indian Digger](http://digg.com/users/Brajeshwar/profile).
