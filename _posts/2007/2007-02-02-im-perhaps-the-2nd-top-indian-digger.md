title: I'm perhaps the 2nd Top Indian Digger
---

I was talking to a smart friend of mine, [Smaran Dayal](http://smarandayal.com/) who is the only Indian Digger on the Top 15 listing on [Digg](http://www.digg.com/). I had been taking the [final look at the Top listing](http://blog.digg.com/?p=60) in the top 100 Diggers and we came to the conclusion that there are no other Indians residents.

I'm perhaps the [2nd Top Indian Digger](http://digg.com/users/Brajeshwar/profile). As with most Top Diggers, he is also not happy with Kevin's move to remove the Top Diggers List.
