excerpt: I was talking to a smart friend of mine, Smaran Dayal who is the only Indian
  Digger on the Top 15 listing on Digg. I had been taking the final look at the Top
  listing in the top 100 Diggers and we came to the conclusion that there are no other
  Resident-Indians between us.

<p><img src="/static/2007/02/digg.jpg" alt="Digg" />I was talking to a smart friend of mine, "Smaran Dayal (Smaran Dayal)":http://smarandayal.com/ who is the only Indian Digger on the Top 15 listing on "Digg (Digg)":http://www.digg.com/. I had been taking the "final look at the Top listing (top diggers)":http://blog.digg.com/?p=60 in the top 100 Diggers and we came to the conclusion that there are no other Indians (though there are Indians Americans) between us. So, I'm perhaps the "2nd Top Indian Digger (2nd Top Indian Digger)":http://digg.com/users/Brajeshwar/profile. As with most Top Diggers, he is also not happy with Kevin's move to "remove the Top Diggers List (remove the Top Diggers List)":http://www.micropersuasion.com/2007/02/by_demotivating.html.</p>
