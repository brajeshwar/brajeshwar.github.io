<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/416196928/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2007/03/zapakgirls.jpg" alt="Malaika Arora Khan as a Zapak Girl" /></a>On Friday, 9th March, 2007, I saw  Malaika Arora Khan posing like Angelina Jolie in the front page of Bombay Times for <a href="http://www.zapakgirls.com/">ZapakGirls</a>. The photo reminded me of <a href="http://www.comicbookhotties.com/models/angelina-jolie-pic.asp">Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft</a>. Malaika wield a Samurai Sword, sling coupla guns, complete with a utility belt and a buckle with the Zapak logo which would definitely not be helpful if she is doing any stunt or even walking for that matter. Her waist even shines with a 3.5" inverted CD with 4 squares etched out which supposedly might be to store/steal/write data from enemy computers. Personally, I feel this is funny and stupid. Malaika do have the oomph factor but not for this Lara Croft type image.<br />

Few months back, a <a href="http://clipthephotos.com/2007/01/pissing-competition-a-boys-game/">pissing competition</a> have urged me to visit <a href="http://zapak.com/">Zapak</a> - a gaming portal for India. Upon opening the website, being a designer-developer myself, my first reaction was, "wow! it is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/416248743/">screwed up in firefox</a>". Then I went straight to the source code to see the error and I was shocked to see full of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/416249848/">TABLES, BGCOLOR</a> in today's world of CSS, XHTML and Web Standards where TABLES are pooh-pooh as design elements. And I am not sure if this is just mere co-incidence but the way that footer is written - rendered using javascript - so you can have a common js file and render amongst all HTMLs reminded me of my old days (2000s) when I wrote that way while doing HTML websites. That's definitely not a properly coded site!</p>
<p>It may be my own fault that I am not a gamer at all. However, the let-down was that I could not find any good quality games despite with the fact that they spend huge on their PR - TV ads, Prints, even to the extend of going to Public Toilets to stick up their <a href="http://clipthephotos.com/2007/01/pissing-competition-a-boys-game/">level game stickers</a>. It will be many years for Zapak to realize a profit to their bold step of trying to milk the non-spending section of the Indian Internet & Game crowd. On a different note, some companies have been allegedly distributing Pirated Game DVDs to help those non-paying-gamers.</p>
<p>Reliance ADA Group, which is behind Zapak, have plans to invest over $100 million over the next 3 years to the gamers, technology, content and PR. Personally, I feel that they have taken a forward looking plan knowing the fact that they will not be making profit at all for at least the next half a decade. The site as of today looks more like a Networking site for Indian gamers.</p>
<p>If you seriously want to play some high quality yet simple & highly addictive games, then <a href="http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/">Orisinal</a> is the best place to be.</p>
