<p><?php ImgBlog("reviews/urban-fonts.jpg", 1, "Urban Fonts", "http://www.urbanfonts.com/");?>This article is a paid article review sponsored by "RevieMe (RevieMe)":http://www.reviewme.com/. However, I'd have written about this resource for great fonts if I found it earlier to *ReviewMe*. If you have feedbacks, please comment or "mail me (mailme)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/contact/ directly. That will help me decide if I should do *ReviewMe* in future or not.<br />

Fonts and dingbats are neatly categorized with large custom color previews. The site also has a "blog (Blog)":http://www.urbanfonts.com/blog/, a "forum (forum)":http://forum.urbanfonts.com/, and an articles section where you can read about fonts and typography. It is templated with tags to help you find the "top searched fonts (top 100 fonts)":http://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/top-100-fonts.htm.</p>
