<p><img src="/static/2007/03/brajeshwar-7.jpg" alt="Brajeshwar Wordpress Theme" style="border: 0 none;" />I've decided to have a dedicated site for the <a href="http://theme.brajeshwar.com/">Brajeshwar Wordpress Theme</a> as people seem to like this theme. Well, well</p>
<p>* Smashing Magazine calls it one of the <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/02/09/83-beautiful-wordpress-themes-you-probably-havent-seen/">most beautiful</a> Wordpress themes<br />
* It is also one of the <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/49-most-downloaded-wordpress-themes-of-all-time/">top most downloaded</a> Wordpress theme (it will cross <a href="http://themes.wordpress.net/columns/3-columns/735/brajeshwar-v70-1/">10,000 downloads</a> very soon just on wordpress.net).<br />
<br />
DETAILS & DOWNLOADS</p>
<p>* Demo, Preview, Updates & Releases in the future will be through the <a href="http://theme.brajeshwar.com/">theme site</a><br />
* I would prefer the downloads from either <a href="http://code.google.com/p/brajeshwar-theme/downloads/list">Google CodeBase</a> or <a href="http://themes.wordpress.net/columns/3-columns/735/brajeshwar-v70-1/">Wordpress Themes</a></p>
<p>For some reason, if you wish to be on the bleeding edge, you can check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/brajeshwar-theme/source">SVN Source</a></p>
<pre>http://brajeshwar-theme.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/brajeshwar-theme</pre>
<p>Btw, don't worry about me, at the time of writing this article, I am still running v7.0 on my own original site - brajeshwar.com.</p>
<p>And here are the bug fixes and enhancements in v7.1.1</p>
<p>* font styles compatible with Microsoft Windows Vista<br />
* removed dependency on the-excerpt-reloaded for the search result (so this theme is now totally plugin independent)<br />
* title style changed to be more search engine friendly<br />
* added a default favicon.ico<br />
* change "blog" to "home"<br />
* changed few arrows to html entities<br />
* added a big noticeable RSS feed icon<br />
* inserted wordpress theme URI in the footer/sidebar along with the "powered by wordpress" tag and the meta tags<br />
* improvised 404 page<br />
* pagination issues fixed wherever needed<br />
* included styles to allow proper image embed complete with a border another style to over-ride for wp-smiley<br />
* included javascript enabled technorati cosmos - home page and article page<br />
* added google adsense leaderboard format which you need to edit to match your google adsense unit<br />
* the highlighted about now gets its value from the Blog Description (Wp Admin > Options) and no need to change in the theme</p>
<p>*UPDATES*</p>
<p>* 2007 April 7 -- There have been well over <a href="http://themes.wordpress.net/columns/3-columns/735/brajeshwar-v70-1/">10,000 downloads</a> just on Wordpress Theme Viewer. I've already created a Google Groups for Brajeshwar Theme for you to ask for new features, get bugs fixed or just talk to me.
