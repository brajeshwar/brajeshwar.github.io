<p>Dear Spam Sender,<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking such an interest in me. I regret to inform you the following:</p>
<p># My penis is just fine, but thank you for asking.<br />
# I don't own a home, so why the fuck would I need to re-finance my mortgage.<br />
# I don't require any medication and even if I did I wouldn't buy it from someone who can't spell the name of it.<br />
# I deeply regret your situation in Nigeria (or whatever 3rd world country you and "your millions of dollars you need to transfer" live in) but you're barking up the wrong tree.<br />
# I already have a degree (again, last time I checked you didn't spell diploma with a 1 in the middle).<br />
# Posing to be the institution I do my banking with, wow, that's fucking admirable. No, you can't have my account information.<br />
# Re: I don't remembering sending you e-mail in the first place.<br />
# "Your PC is infected". No it isn't, I have a Mac which doesn't open your fucked up .exe files, you stupid.<br />
# Thanks for the stock tip, unfortunately I didn't see a listing on NASDAQ for: bL06Wjob GraNNy99.<br />
# Chicks banging horses is soooo 1999.</p>
<p>Bye for now,<br />
Brajeshwar</p>
