<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/"><img style="border: 0 none;" src="/static/2007/01/flickrstream.jpg" alt="Brajeshwar's Photos" class="alignright" /></a>Of late, my "Flickr Photos (Flickr Photos)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/ are getting quite a bit of attention, more specifically with the inclusion of the "Windows Vista Wallpaper (Windows Vista Wallpaper)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/sets/72157594389648659/ collection. The Photos stream has garnered almost half a million views ever since I shifted my photos to Flickr from my hosted Gallery in "March, 2006 (March, 2006)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/archives/. At this rate, it will easily cross half a million views per year (by March 2007).</p>
<p>There is no way to see your "Flickr (Flickr)":http://www.flickr.com/ Photo usage statistics. Someone may be blogging your photos, praising your photos and linking back to your Flickstream. The best way so far is to track through "Technorati (Technorati)":http://www.technorati.com/. To know where your Flickr photos are being linked, blogged or mentioned elsewhere, setup a "Technorati Search Feed (Technorati Search Feed)":http://www.technorati.com/search/www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/ for your "Flickstream (Flickstream)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/.</p>
<p><!--more--><br />
Once you set a search for your FlickrStream, you should get the RSS feed icon in your Browser Address Bar (I user "Firefox (Firefox)":http://www.mozilla.com/) and you should be able to subscribe to the same. The feed is usually the replacement of the "www" with "feeds" in the resulting URL. The RSS Feed in my case looks something like this - http://feeds.technorati.com/search/www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/. This is perhaps not the perfect solution for your Flickr photos Stats but it serves enough to tracks your FlickrStream.</p>
<p>*UPDATES*</p>
