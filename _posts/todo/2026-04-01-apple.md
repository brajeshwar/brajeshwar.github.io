Today, my advice would be not to be tied to any ecosystem, not even the Apple Ecosystem. Of course, the Apple Ecosystem is indeed the best and things just works. Nonetheless, make plans to [you can walk](/2025/can-i-walk-out/) out with minimal effect on your lifestyle, when the need arises.

I was lured to the Ecosystem with an [iPod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod) in 2005 at the [Fry’s Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fry%27s_Electronics), Los Angeles. oh! That experience inside that large electronics store for a small-town boy was a `kid in a candy store` experience, kinda similar feeling stepping into the multi-floor electronics and gadgets mall in Singapore.

In 2006, an Investor gifted me a 17-inch Apple Mac PowerBook and that’s when I got [converted from Windows to Mac](/2006/mac-convert-am-i/). The day, in 2022, when I bought the [Apple Polishing Cloth](/2022/apple-polishing-cloth/) was the day I realized I’m stuck and I needed an exit plan to, one day, [just walk out](/2025/can-i-walk-out/).

My first iPhone was the 2nd Generation iPhone, iPhone 3G, which was [launched in India in August 2008](/2008/iphone-3g-india-22-august/). I got mine via Vodafone in December 2008, just in time to take pictures of my daughter.

I bought the [1st Generation iPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation)) in November 2010 from the Apple [Stanford Shopping Center](https://www.simon.com/mall/stanford-shopping-center), Palo Alto. This was, with good intention, bought to teach my daughter and stay in touch while I travel. I remember a relative helping trim the SIM card to fit it in.

I use Apple devices for the function, not the form. Nonetheless, it has been Turtles all the way down.

[^Apple]: [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) was established on April 1, 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to sell the Apple I personal computer kit. “Apple Computer, Inc.” was incorporated January 3, 1977 without Wayne, who sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800. It was renamed “Apple Inc.” in 2007.
