Today, my advice would be not to be tied to any ecosystem, not even the Apple Ecosystem. Of course, the Apple Ecosystem is the best and things just works. Make plans so [you can walk](/2025/can-i-walk-out/) out with minimal effect on your lifestyle.

Started with an iPod at the Frys, Los Angeles.
2006, MacBook 16-inch gifted by an Investor and got [converted from Windows to Mac](/2006/mac-convert-am-i/).

First iPhone, the iPhone 3G, was [launched in India in August 2008](/2008/iphone-3g-india-22-august/). I got mine via Vodafone in December 2008, just in time to take pictures of my daughter.

[iPad 1st Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation)) in November 2010 from Stanford Apple Store. This was, with good intention, bought to teach my daughter and stay in touch. I remember a relative helping trim the SIM card to fit it in.

[^Apple]: [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) was established on April 1, 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to sell the Apple I personal computer kit. “Apple Computer, Inc.” was incorporated January 3, 1977 without Wayne, who sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800. It was renamed “Apple Inc.” in 2007.
