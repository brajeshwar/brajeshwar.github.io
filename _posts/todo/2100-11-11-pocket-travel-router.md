# Pocket Travel Router

I’ve have had always used a Pocket Travel Router for the longest time — since the early 2000s. I started with the D-Link AC750 Travel Router, which was small enough for easy carry while I travel.

Then, I moved on to Apple Airport Express, then to TP-Link’s Portable Mini Travel Routers. If I remember correctly, the Airport Express can only use an Ethernet Cable as its source.
