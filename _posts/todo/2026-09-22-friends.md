# Friends

I realized [Friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends) is one of my comfort [TV Series](https://brajeshwar.com/film/#tv). I grew up watching it off and on, and it was always playing someone on [Channel V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_V) or [MTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV) or something of that sort.

It is not even the best but something I can just let it run, and not think about it. It is a sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired from September 22, 1994 to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. The show revolves around the six friends in their 20s and early 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City.
