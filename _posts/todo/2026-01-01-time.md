# Time

`A Work-in-Progress.`

Most of us systematically undervalue our time.

Whether itâ€™s with friends, family, life, or work, finding high-leverage activities, tackling the toughest challenges, boosting efficiency, and making the most of incremental time is a goal worth striving for.

This is not about being slow, unproductive, or just taking time to do something that someone loves. They are complementary to one another. The difference is in the mindset, the degree of agency with which we use our effort, and the time given to us.
