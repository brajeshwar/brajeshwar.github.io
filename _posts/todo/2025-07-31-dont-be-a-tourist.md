# Don’t Be A Tourist

While on a train ride in Amsterdam, a friend once told me, “Come on! Don’t be a Tourist.” I love that. Wherever you travel, Don’t be a Tourist.

When you arrive in a new place, no one really cares about your matching socks and sandals. What they do notice is whether you speak a few words of the language or if you actually step into a local bakery instead of the chain you have back home. Don’t be the person who complains that the local coffee is weird and that you miss your Grande Caramel Frappuccino with extra cream. 

Sometimes, it’s okay to turn off your apps’ guided voice and open your eyes to look around and enjoy the view. Head down a side street instead of the main avenue lined with souvenir shops. That is where you will find the old man who has been making shoes for forty years and has never heard of Instagram. Buy a pair of hand-stitched loafers, even if they make your feet cry a little. It is worth it.

So ditch the fanny pack, learn a greeting or two, and then get lost on purpose. Order something you cannot pronounce. Laugh at yourself when you are wrong. Learn that messing up is part of the fun.

It is not a performance. It’s messy, awkward, spicy, and sometimes gives you bad breath. But it is yours. The best souvenir is the story you cannot fit into an Instagram caption. So pack light, wander far, and Don’t be a Tourist.
