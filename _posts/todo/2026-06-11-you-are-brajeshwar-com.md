# You are brajeshwar.com?

In 2010-2011, I was in Mountain View while undergoing an [entrepreneurship course at the Founder Institute](/2011/the-founder-institute-experience/). Well, besides the usual coffee and lunch places, I frequented [Hacker Dojo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Dojo). I remember that my friends and I even did some presentations, and participated in a few [Hackathons](/2025/breaking-the-innovation-theatre/) there.

On one fateful rainy evening, as usual, I was slouched on my Laptop on one of the common desk at Hacker Dojo. Someone approached me and asked, “You are brajeshwar.com, right?” (or something in that line). We chatted a bit and I was super happy about that. I could no longer recollect who that was.

It was also at this time that I registered the domain `hackathon.co` (Feb 14, 2011) to run hackathons and write about it. I later sold the domain and the content for a good sum within few months of its registration and launch.
