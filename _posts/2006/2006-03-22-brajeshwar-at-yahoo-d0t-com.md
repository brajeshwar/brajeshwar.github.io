excerpt: Yahoo, Hotmail
---
<p>I signed up for a "Yahoo! (Yahoo!)":http://www.yahoo.com/ and a "Hotmail (Hotmail)":http://www.hotmail.com/ account in 1999. I have the Hotmail account under my control but I forgot my password for Yahoo!</p>
<p>I have </p>
<p>* tried all permutations and combinations to retrieve the password with their "Forgot Password" without success<br />
* tried calling them up without success<br />
* tried mailing them many times without success</p>
<p>Well, the thing is that I usually get all accounts/IDs on the internet with my name as my name is a not-so-common name. I would really like to yet my own Yahoo! account with my name. And yes, that account is mine and is now dormant due to inactivity.</p>
<p>*I would like to request anybody to try and get me that by any means - hack, crack or anything.*<br />
<br />
In return, I would do social service to the Internet Community by spending atleast *2 hours daily Monday to Friday for one month* replying, helping developers/designers on forums and mailing list. I would not just reply to common querries but would try my best to get to the more challenging and difficult ones and try to solve them for aspiring developers/designers.</p>
<p>And I would of course make a special big *Thank You* link/page on my site for whoever can get me the ID and it will remain as long as my site remains on the internet.</p>
<p>If I am lucky to get a Yahoo! representative interested in this, I am happy to answer all questions to prove that brajeshwar (at) yahoo (d0t) com is me and was created by me.</p>
