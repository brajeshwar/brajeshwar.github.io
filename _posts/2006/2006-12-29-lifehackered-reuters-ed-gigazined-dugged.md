# LifeHackered, Reuters-ed, Gigazined, Dugged

Alright, I had stopped looking at referrers that goes to the [Microsoft Windows Vista Wallpapers](/2006/microsoft-windows-vista-wallpapers/) but today I saw something strange at the analytics' `Unique Referrer`.

About a month back, my site was [Lifehackered](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/wallpaper/free-windows-vista-wallpaper-217114.php) and it seriously beats all other referrer now. The surprise I saw today was when my site got [Reuters-ed](http://today.reuters.com/News/ArticleBlog.aspx?type=technologyNews&w1=B7ovpm21IaDoL40ZFnNfGe&w2=B82x9Ksc5UNVzDjpITcIrRbi&src=blogBurst_technologyNews&bbPostId=CzBrwwbnhPUOdCz5x9FDMaTOCUAaUGC6n8mUsCzCNgl8eMm7Qv).

Well, it got [Gigazined](http://gigazine.net/index.php?/news/comments/20061126_vistawall/) for the same Vista Wallpapers. The article too got [dugg](http://www.digg.com/) indirectly.
