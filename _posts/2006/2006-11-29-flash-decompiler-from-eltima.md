[Flash Decompiler](http://www.swf-kit.com/swftofla-decompiler.html) is an SWF tool that lets you decompile SWF files and converts SWF documents into FLAs. Moreover, it can also export FLVs into AVI and other playable formats. You can decompile any Flash movie and extract frames, morphs, sounds, texts, images, videos, shapes, fonts, buttons, sprites and ActionScripts from any SWF file. All the extracted elements can be easily saved on a hard drive. All of the exported SWF elements can be stored in multiple formats -- sounds as WAV and MP3, images - as PNG, JPEG and BMP, videos - as FLV, texts as RTF, TXT and HTML. Projector files can be decompiled the same way as regular SWF ones.

SWF Capture Tool, featured in Flash Decompiler, enables you to save any SWF to your hard drive with a single click on the built-in button in Internet Explorer. The *Replace SWF Objects* option makes it possible to modify any given SWF file without the conversion process. Lines, gradients, sounds, images and colors in SWF movies can be replaced easily.
