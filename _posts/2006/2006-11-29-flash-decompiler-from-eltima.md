Moreover, it can also export FLVs into AVI and other playable formats. You can decompile any Flash movie and extract frames, morphs, sounds, texts, images, videos, shapes, fonts, buttons, sprites and ActionScripts from any SWF file. All the extracted elements can be easily saved on a hard drive. All of the exported SWF elements can be stored in multiple formats -- sounds as WAV and MP3, images - as PNG, JPEG and BMP, videos - as FLV, texts as RTF, TXT and HTML. Projector files can be decompiled the same way as regular SWF ones.</p>
