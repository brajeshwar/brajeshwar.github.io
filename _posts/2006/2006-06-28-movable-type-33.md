# Movable Type 3.3

I have been beta testing [Movable Type 3.3](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/beta/) and was pretty impressed with many new features. Of all the features, my favorites are that of tags, stylecatcher and the [dirify function fix](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200510/fixing_the_dirify_function_in_movable_type/).
