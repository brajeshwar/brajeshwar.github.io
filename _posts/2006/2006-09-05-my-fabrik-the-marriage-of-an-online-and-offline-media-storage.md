Earlier during the month of July Niall Kennedy wrote an article - "Fabrik storage at home and in the clouds (Fabrik storage at home and in the clouds)":http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/06/fabrik-maxtor-storage.html where he talks about the integration of the online storage service and the offline storage. One of the cool thing about "My Fabrik (My Fabrik)":http://www.myfabrik.com/ is its ability to share your documents, media with other people and even drop them on other online services like "MySpace (MySpace)":http://www.myspace.com/, "Blogger (Blogger)":http://www.blogger.com/, your own blog or on any website/blog for that matter.</p>
<p>I'm still exploring this "Weblication (Weblication)":http://fabrikinc.com/weblication.php and I have a feeling as if I am on my own Mac. My Fabrik is definitely done by people who love the Apple Mac. It even has a Mac Flavor to its interface. You may even be amazed that there are features that you will keep stumbling upon as you continue to explore the application.</p>
