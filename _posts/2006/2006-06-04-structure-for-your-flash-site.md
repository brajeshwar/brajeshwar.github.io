title: Structure for your Flash Site
---

Mark Angeletti mailed me to inform about a nice article on how to [Structure a Flash Site](http://www.search-this.com/website_design/structure_flash_site.aspx). A good primer for a Flash Newbie going into the intermediate stage and more apt for small to mid size Flash Site. It will take much more than this to even shape up for an intermediate to big Applications. The article still serves as a good foundation for Fresh Flash Developers wishing going deeper into Flash Development.

It shows how to use Keyframes, ActionScript, MovieClips and to control the Flash playhead. Mark claims that, "Optimizing your use of these elements can help you reduce file size, minimize download times, and create efficiencies that make altering your work easy."
