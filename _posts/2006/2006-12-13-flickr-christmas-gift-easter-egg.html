<p><?php ImgBlog("general/flickr-gift.jpg", 0, "Flickr Gift", "http://www.flickr.com/gift/");?>*Easter Egg - Christmas 2006*</p>
<p>Saw this off "Boing Boing (Boing Boing)":http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/12/flickrs_excellent_xm.html. If you post a Note on your Flickr Photo, it will show you the corresponding object - hat, beard. Find the Easter Egg; type the following words in the Note (without the quotes)</p>
<p>* "ho ho ho hat" -- draws a Santa-hat on your pic<br />
* "ho ho ho beard" -- draws a snowy white beard.<br />
<!--more--><br />
*Christmas Gift from Flickr*</p>
<p>You can purchase a special activation code that you can give to anyone, whether or not they have an existing Flickr account. Flickr have created a "special Gift Certificate (Flickr Christmas Gift)":http://www.flickr.com/gift/ card that you can print out yourself, fold up and stuff in a stocking, under a tree or hidden away for after the candles are lit (of course, you can also send the gift code in an email).</p>
<p>The recipients will get unlimited uploads Ã‡Æ’Ã“ the two gigabyte monthly limit is no more. So, pro users have no limits on how many photos they can upload). At the same time, Flickr have upped the limit for free account members as well, from 20MB per month up to 100MB (five times more).</p>
