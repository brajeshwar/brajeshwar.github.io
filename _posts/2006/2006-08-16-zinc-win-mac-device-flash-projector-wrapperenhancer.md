<p>Once popularly known as *Flash Studio Pro*, Zinc in its current 2.x version have advanced way ahead in Flash Projector addition/enhancement/replacement capabilities. At the time of writing this article, "Zinc (Zinc)":http://www.multidmedia.com/ has already "implemented support (Zinc support Flash Player 9, ActionScript 3.0)":http://www.multidmedia.com/news/news.php?id=62 for Flash Player 9, ActionScript 3.0. Nonetheless, it may be noted that Zinc can publish to Flash Player 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8; thus enabling creation of powerful desktop applications for Windows, Mac and Pocket PC Device.</p>
<p>With a plethora of customization - skins, styles, size, icons that comes with it, Zinc can instantly bring out a rich looking Desktop Application right away even before you could get deep into it. Well, that is just the beginning of the good things - you'll be amazed by the power of the "MDM Script (MDM Script)":http://www.multidmedia.com/support/learning/docs/. {mdm} Script can enhance the power of your Flash Desktop Application to a robust, powerful application.<br />
<br />
One of the striking feature, I like about Zinc is its support for the MAC OSX. With the recent release of its Zinc 2.5.0.15 (at the time of this article, its latest Zinc OSX was 2.5.0.16), MDM have added support for Intel Mac. And yes, Zinc OSX now has the ability to output Mac Screensavers. The Mac OSX version is available as a *Standalone* or a *Plug-in* for Windows users (this allows windows Zinc users to directly export to a Mac OSX Projector).</p>
