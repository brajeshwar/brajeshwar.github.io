excerpt: First, I am amazed by the sleek, clean, crisp design of the Mac Software
  interfaces and their interactivity. It is the ultimate WOW factor in design, speed
  and the work it can do for you.

<p>Guy Watson recently wrote an article that he is a "Mac convert (Mac convert)":http://www.flashguru.co.uk/im-now-a-mac-dude/. "Abdul Qabiz (Abdul Qabiz)":http://www.abdulqabiz.com/ too is a proud owner of a "Macbook (Macbook)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/183225267/.</p>
<p>Some of our team are already Mac Guys!</p>

<p>And I won't be surprised if "Arindam Biswas (Arindam Biswas)":http://www.arindambiswas.com/ goes for a Mac with his next iteration of his Notebook!</p>

<p>I am shifting to "my Mac (Brajeshwar's Mac)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/175470064/ but rather in a slow pace. I have to be careful that everything gets sync at the right time with the right software conversion. I have never used a Mac seriously besides testing for compatibility, browser behavior, etc. and I never felt the need to move. It is not that I am against Mac or that I love Windows; I was just concerned with getting my works done the fastest and the best way possible. Oh! I would have not shifted so early if not for "Keyur's Gift (Keyur's Gift)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/175469951/!</p>
<p>First, I am amazed by the sleek, clean, crisp design of the Mac Software interfaces and their interactivity. It is the ultimate *WOW* factor that gets you right in your face when you're in front of a Mac. I have already fallen in deep love with "Adium (Adium)":http://www.adiumx.com/ which is a universal Instant Messenger for Mac. I was a die hard user of "Trillian Pro (Trillian Pro)":http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/ for windows for the past coupla years. Even my site visitors' percentage for "Safari (Safari)":http://www.apple.com/safari/ have increased from 1% about a year ago to 5% currently. My primary concern is now about "Email Management (Email Management)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/2005/why-outlook-is-preferred-by-business-professionals/, "Version Control - SVN (Version Control - SVN)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/2005/dude-version-it-with-cvsdude/, "RSS Feed Management (RSS Feed Management)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/2005/newsgator-outlook-edition-feeds-news-reader/ and "Keepass (Keepass)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/2005/keepass-password-safe/</p>
<p>Some of the few sites' feed that I have already subscribed are like</p>
<p>* "I Use This (I Use This)":http://osx.iusethis.com/<br />
* "Mac Update (Mac Update)":http://www.macupdate.com/</p>
<p>Having seen, done and said good things about Mac, I have to be careful that I do the transition on a gradual manner! "Keeping both the machines (PC and Mac)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/183503091/; using both of them appropriately is the best bet for now; will try to pin-point and switch applications that are equivalent or better on the Mac.</p>
