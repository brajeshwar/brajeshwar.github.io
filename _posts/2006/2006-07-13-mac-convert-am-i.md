title: Mac Convert! Am I?
---

Guy Watson, aka Flash Guru, recently got converted to a Mac. [Abdul Qabiz](http://www.abdulqabiz.com/) too is a proud owner of a [MacBook](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/183225267/).

Some of our team at Mixercast are already Mac Guys!

I am converting to a Mac. I have never used a Mac seriously besides testing for compatibility, browser behavior, etc. and I never felt the need to move. It is not that I am against Mac or that I love Windows; I was just concerned with getting my works done the fastest and the best way possible.

Thanks for Keyu Patel for gifting me an [Apple Mac PowerBook](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/175469951/)

First, I am amazed by the sleek, clean, crisp design of the Mac Software interfaces and their interactivity. I have already fallen in deep love with [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/) which is a universal Instant Messenger for Mac. I was a die hard user of [Trillian Pro](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/) for windows for the past coupla years. Even my site visitors' percentage for [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) have increased from 1% about a year ago to 5% currently.

My primary concerns are [Email Management](/2005/why-outlook-is-preferred-by-business-professionals/), [Version Control - SVN](/2005/dude-version-it-with-cvsdude/), [RSS Feed Management](/2005/newsgator-outlook-edition-feeds-news-reader/) and [Password Management](/2005/keepass-password-safe/).

Welcome to the world of MacOS.
