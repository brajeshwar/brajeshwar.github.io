# Mac Convert! Am I?

Guy Watson (Flash Guru) recently got converted to a Mac. [Abdul Qabiz](http://www.abdulqabiz.com/) too is a proud owner of a [MacBook](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/183225267/).

Some of our team at Mixercast are already on MacBooks - [Freeman Murray](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/182305644/), [Bill Lee](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/181518054/), [Soumyadeep Paul](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/165580106/).

Besides the usual testing for compatibility, browser behavior, etc., I have never used a Mac seriously, and I never felt the need to change. It is not that I am against Mac or love Windows; I was just concerned with getting my work done the fastest and the best way possible.

Thanks to Keyur Patel for the beautiful [Apple Mac PowerBook](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/175469951/).

First, I am amazed by the sleek, clean, crisp design of the Mac Software interfaces and their interactivity. I have already fallen in love with [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/), a universal Instant Messenger for Mac. I was a die-hard user of [Trillian Pro](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/) for Windows for the past couple of years. Even my site visitors' percentage for [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) has increased from 1% about a year ago to 5%.

My primary concerns are [Email Management](/2005/why-outlook-is-preferred-by-business-professionals/), [Version Control - SVN](/2005/dude-version-it-with-cvsdude/), [RSS Feed Management](/2005/newsgator-outlook-edition-feeds-news-reader/) and [Password Management](/2005/keepass-password-safe/).

Welcome to the world of MacOS.
