title: Donate to Wikipedia, Give the Gift of Knowledge
---

I just [donated](http://fundraising.wikimedia.org/) my contribution of a sum of $100 to ["]Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/). At the time I donated, it has already raised about $743,000. If we donate some amount each, it will hit a million very soon.
