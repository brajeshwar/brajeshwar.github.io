title: Vongo - Choose Now Watch Now
---

I saw the post popped up on [FullAsAGoog](http://fullasagoog.com/) and [MXNA](http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mxna/) coupla days back but it never strike me as much as it should have.

Nonthless, it lingered in the back of my brain about its relations to `Oinam Software` and yes, I was part of their Flash Team writing the video client-side encorder. It was not in my project radar as [Vongo](http://www.vongo.com/) was on the CVS of [Shcematic](http://www.schematic.com/) and not our Oinam's SVN.

[Danny Patterson](http://www.dannypatterson.com/Resources/Blog/EntryDetail.cfm?ID=82) says he worked on it for about 9 months with 9 other Flash Developers. I could recollect only him and [Joey Lott](http://www.person13.com/) to be the persons whom I recognize on the CVS Commit notification so I am sure mine was the minimum work of the all other 9 developers. But now, upon reading the articles in length, it is a great feeling to know that I was able to take part in such a big project.

Vongo from [Starz](http://www.starz.com/) is a desktop application that allows you to search, preview and download many of the great movies Starz has access to.
