title: Del.icio.us enables import feature
---

I wanted this feature and del.icio.us always kept it crossed. However, today, I saw that [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) have enabled it. If you wish to import your bookmarks to del.icio.us, check out the `settings > import` feature.

Well, there are issues right now.

- How do I share all my bookmarks at one go? (I can look up for the tag system:import and do a manual edit!)
- Shouldn't there be an option to do an edit all kinda?
- Or am I missing something here?
