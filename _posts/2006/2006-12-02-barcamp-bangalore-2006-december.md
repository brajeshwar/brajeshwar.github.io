title: Barcamp Bangalore - 2006 December
---

The second Barcamp Bangalore took off on the 2nd of December, 2006. The camp started off with a fresh presentation giving up tips on how to approach VCs with ideas and innovations, from Sandeep Singhal of Sequoia Capital.

I really like the enthusiasm of the presenters of the *Controversies of the Indian Blogosphere*. Good to learn the other side of the coin from where you belong - being bloggers, enterprising entrepreneur and a digerati.

The Lunch was great. I always had a dislike for foods at events, conferences but this one is one of those rare ones that I liked. I think just like others, I ate to my full.

I did my preso on [Nanocast](http://www.nanocast.com/), mostly demo of the application and how to have your Nanocasts everywhere on any platform - blogger, myspace, xanga, your own blog, virtually everywhere. I will be writing my detailed review of Nanocast later and thus won't like to go deep into it. The cool thing about my session was culmination of both technical and business interest between me and the people listening to me.

[MingleBox](http://www.minglebox.com/) is an Orkut type but targeted to the Indian users. Looks promising and the idea that they can compete with Orkut is awesome. The internet is a big ocean and all fishes can survive, not just the big sharks but even the small ones never go hungry. So, they still have a chance to make it big and have their India oriented niche community. My best wishes to them.
