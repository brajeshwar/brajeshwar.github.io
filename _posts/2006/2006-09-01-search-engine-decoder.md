Mark Angeletti emailed me about [Search Engine Decoder](http://www.search-this.com/search_engine_decoder.asp) long back but never got a chance to play around with it. This is kinda cool application whereby the buttons, when clicked, activate colored arrows that chart who supplies who with what.

For example, Google supplies primary results to AOL, NetScape, Alexa, GO.com and Dogpile. It also supplies paid results to AOL, GO.com, Ask, Hotbot, NetScape, Lycos and Alexa. Well, it looks like half of all searches go through Google.
