excerpt: Being a developer himself once, he still have the inkling feeling of how
  developers feel about the applications they develop. He was thus able to give us
  quick guides on how and where to improve. Personally, I was immensely thrilled and
  overwhelmed interacting with him closely during his tenure here.
