excerpt: I really think that Bollywood should stick to their song sequences, rain
  dances, family drama, the colors and the no-brainer comedies.

<p>Coupla days back, I wrote about "How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a life (How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a life)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/2006/how-opal-mehta-got-kissed-got-wild-and-got-a-life/, a book which I read because of the Plagiarism Controversy. Little did I realize that, today I would be treated to another surprise about the extend of plagiarism in the Indian cinema popularly known as "Bollywood (Bollywood)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood.</p>
<p>I and many other Indian Cine-Movie goers are perfectly used to the fact that Bollywood Movies got inspirations from many Hollywood and other foreign movies. I have seen many bollywood movies that have exact replica of shots, ideas and execution - mix blends of 2-3 movies, masala-ed with story ideas from fiction novels - Sidney Sheldon, _et al_. I saw the movie "Krrish (Krrish)":http://www.krrishthemovie.com/ today at the behest of our team. As soon as the movie's part of the story-line cross that of "Paycheck (Paycheck)":http://www.paycheckmovie.com/, I smiled - *Paycheck* - but then that was not a surprise for me at all.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My surprise hit me when I saw that their future-seeing-computer interface to be something I have seen many times before. The interface was somewhat like the 2Advanced's "Expansions Video Demo Reel (Expansions Video Demo Reel)":http://v3.2a-archive.com/demoreel_hirez.htm - a guy drags UI objects on a glass like thingy to manipulate commands (watch the "low resolution video demo reel (low resolution video demo reel)":http://v3.2a-archive.com/demoreel_lowrez.htm instead). </p>
<p>If not, I think I can still look at my External Archive Disc (I practically don't delete files) and find that video (I am assuming that is over 3 years old). And I saw many movements that were perhaps done in flash or some 3D stuff which were copied versions of the 2Advanced "V.3 (2Advanced V.3)":http://v3.2a-archive.com/ and "V.4 (2Advanced V.4)":http://v4.2a-archive.com/ interface; the funny part is that they have the "2Advanced (2Advanced)":http://www.2advanced.com/ Logo swiping-with-the-glossy-shiny thingy too. Unless "2Advanced (2Advanced)":http://www.2advanced.com/ was involved with the making of "Krrish (Krrish)":http://www.krrishthemovie.com/ that is a real shame to whoever is involved with those effects.</p>
<p>I really think that Bollywood should stick to their song sequences, rain dances, family drama, the colors and the no-brainer comedies.</p>
<p>2Advanced was an inspiration to many designers eons ago and very recently "Plat4m (Plat4m)":http://www.plat4m.com/ reported few more on their "rip-report (rip-report)":http://www.plat4m.com/rip-report/ - "2Advanced V.4 vs. DJ Miki Cino (2Advanced V.4 vs. DJ Miki Cino)":http://www.plat4m.com/rip-report/reports-live/2advanced-vs-trac-racing/, "2Advanced.net vs. Rusty Designs (2Advanced.net vs. Rusty Designs)":http://www.plat4m.com/rip-report/reports-live/2advancednet-vs-rusty-designs/, "2Advanced V.4 vs. Trac Racing (2Advanced V.4 vs. Trac Racing)":http://www.plat4m.com/rip-report/reports-live/2advanced-vs-trac-racing/.</p>
