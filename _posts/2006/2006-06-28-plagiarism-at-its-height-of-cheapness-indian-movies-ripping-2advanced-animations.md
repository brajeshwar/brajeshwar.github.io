# Plagiarism at its height of cheapness - Indian movies ripping 2Advanced animations

Coupla days back, I wrote about [How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a life](/2006/how-opal-mehta-got-kissed-got-wild-and-got-a-life/), a book which I read because of the Plagiarism Controversy. Little did I realize that, today I would be treated to another surprise about the extend of plagiarism in Indian cinema.

I and many other Indian Cine-Movie goers are perfectly used to the fact that Bollywood Movies got inspirations from many Hollywood and other foreign movies. I have seen many bollywood movies that have exact replica of shots, ideas and execution - mix blends of 2-3 movies, masala-ed with story ideas from fiction novels - Sidney Sheldon, etc. I saw the movie [Krrish](http://www.krrishthemovie.com/) today at the behest of our team. As soon as the movie's part of the story-line cross that of [Paycheck](http://www.paycheckmovie.com/), I smiled - *Paycheck* - but then that was not a surprise for me at all.

My surprise hit me when I saw that their future-seeing-computer interface to be something I have seen many times before. The interface was somewhat like the 2Advanced's [Expansions Video Demo Reel](http://v3.2a-archive.com/demoreel_hirez.htm) - a guy drags UI objects on a glass like thingy to manipulate commands. I saw many movements that were perhaps done in flash or some 3D stuff which were copied versions of the 2Advanced [V.3](http://v3.2a-archive.com/) and [V.4](http://v4.2a-archive.com/) interface; the funny part is that they have the [2Advanced](http://www.2advanced.com/) Logo swiping-with-the-glossy-shiny thingy too. Unless 2Advanced was involved with the making of Krrish that is a real shame to whoever is involved with those effects.

I really think that Bollywood should stick to their song sequences, rain dances, family drama, the colors and the no-brainer comedies.

2Advanced was an inspiration to many designers eons ago and very recently [Plat4m](http://www.plat4m.com/) reported few more on their [rip-report](http://www.plat4m.com/rip-report/);
