<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2006/06/iitmshaastra2006-flashgames.gif" alt="IIT-Madras - Shaastra '06 - Flash Games" style="border: 0 none;" />Yesterday, I got an email from "IIT-Madras (IIT-Madras)":http://www.iitm.ac.in/ about inclusion of a "Flash Games Competition (Flash Games Competition)":http://www.shaastra.org/n/events/Flash+Games in their upcoming "IIT-M Shaastra '06 (IIT-M Shaastra '06)":http://www.shaastra.org/. The Flash Game Development Competition is being introduced for the first time in The IIT-Madras Shaastra, which is being held during October this year. This is indeed good news that Flash is slowly being recognized and given the due respect by the IITs.</p>
<p>The objective for the contestants is to design highly addictive games in Flash. Participation can be done in teams/individuals, with no restriction on the size of the team. Certain selected games will be put up in a Gaming Arcade - FlashDrome. Final judging will be done by people attending the FlashDrome.</p>
