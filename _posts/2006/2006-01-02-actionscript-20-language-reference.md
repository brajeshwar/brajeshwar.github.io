# ActionScript 2.0 Language Reference

Macromedia published a downloadable Reference for ActionScript 2.0 Language. There is a HTML version, which you can host it yourself and a PDF version that you can print.

We have a version hosted for our team at -- [Oinam's ActionScript 2.0](https://archives.oinam.com/as2/).
