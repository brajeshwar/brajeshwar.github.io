Early morning of Apr 8, 2006 our team set out on a 2 day Team Picnic to Splendour Country, a resort on the outskirts of Pune, India. Ealier, we did our new trainee introduction to the team with a [Movie and Bowling](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/sets/72057594100307364/) session. It may be a small endeavor on our part but we have been pushing our work/play culture to be more in the lines of not just a working office environment but like a college/university campus where people love to hang out, chill and work in the due process. Our Work/Play Environment Motto have always been `People First` and our work ethics `What's Next`.

## Why People First?

This is rather my own axiom that if the people involved with the team are good, progressing ahead and are well informed, then the team on the whole progresses ahead. We do not groom our company/team to be good so that the people in it can benefit but we groom our people so that the company/team can benefit in return. Every individual in our team is thus very important; individual growth is our primary goal. If that primary goal is achieved the others falls well in their rightful place automagically.

So, why not join our team?

We're extremely confident that you will never regret joining our team.
