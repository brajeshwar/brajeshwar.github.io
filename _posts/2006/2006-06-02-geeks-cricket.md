excerpt: It was around 1:00 am in the night, the team just returned from another rush-hour
  ordeal of development - actionscript, remoting, hibernate, java, database, et al.
  Too much of time spent on the keyboard/mouse have tempted the team to try on something
  different -- Cricket.

<p>It was around 1:00 am in the night, the team just returned from another rush-hour ordeal of development - actionscript, remoting, hibernate, java, database, <em>et al</em>. Too much of time spent on the keyboard/mouse have tempted the team to try on something different - "Cricket (Wikipedia's definition of Cricket)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket.</p>

<p>You can see coupla IBM Thinkpads lying around, we were about to use them as *Stumps* but somehow decided against that idea!</p>
