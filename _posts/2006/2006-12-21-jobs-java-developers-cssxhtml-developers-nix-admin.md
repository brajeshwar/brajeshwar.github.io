title: Jobs - Java Developers, CSS/XHTML Developers, *nix Admin

It was a lucky day that I attended a cool session at the <a href="/2006/barcamp-bangalore-2006-december/">Barcamp Bangalore 2</a> and I instantly decided to ask the guy if he would be interested in being a part of our team. We exchanged emails, phone numbers and I took his <a href="/2006/how-to-write-an-effective-resume-how-to-get-your-curriculum-vitae-right/">resume</a>. We are the final stage of finalizing our agreement with this guy. I'd like to keep his identity and his session at Barcamp to myself till we officially finalize his integration with our team.
