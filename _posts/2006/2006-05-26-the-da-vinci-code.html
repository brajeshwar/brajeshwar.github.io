excerpt: Yesterday late in the evening, I went to see the preview screening of The
  "Da Vinci Code (Da Vinci Code)":http://www.davincicode.com/ and found the movie
  good against all the not-so-good reviews that abounds the internet. Nonetheless,
  I felt that it was a bit slow-paced. Recollecting, I read the "book (Dan Brown's
  Da Vinci Code the Book)":http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/ in a day's
  time and was more absorbed in that than the movie.

<p>India was supposed to screen The Da Vinci Code "along with the world (The Da Vinci Code Movie Release Date worldwide)":http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/davincicode/international/ on the 19th of May, 2006 but due to the controversy, it was decided that the movie can be screened but with a "disclaimer (Disclaimer duel may delay Da Vinci Code)":http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1539951.cms at the beginning and at the end of the movie that the characters are fictious, the movie is a work of fiction. Well, that delayed the movie release by a week. Finally, The Da Vinci Code is being released in India today (May 26, 2006).</p>
<p>Yesterday late in the evening, I went to see the preview screening of The "Da Vinci Code (Da Vinci Code)":http://www.davincicode.com/ and found the movie good against all the not-so-good reviews that abounds the internet. Nonetheless, I felt that it was a bit slow-paced. Recollecting, I read the "book (Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code the Book)":http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/ in a day's time and was more absorbed in that than the movie.</p>
<p>I felt Tom Hanks (who played the famed symbologist Professor Robert Langdon) did not get much chance of displaying his versatile acting skill in this movie, (remember "Cast Away (Cast Away)":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162222/, "The Terminal (The Terminal)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2004/09/the-terminal/, _et al_) and I wished that the French actor Audrey Tautou (who plays the cryptologist Sophie Neveu) was a bit more reactive, agile. Or was it that they played their role just right, right to the point where they should and not really overplay! Having read the book earlier, I was perhaps expecting the movie to deliver more. Anyway, the movie was a good-to-see movie.</p>
