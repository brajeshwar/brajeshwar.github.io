<p>During early 2005, I noticed that "Brajeshwar v5.1 was bluntly copied (Brajeshwar.com v5.1 template bluntly copied!)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/archives/2005/01/brajeshwarcom-v51-template-bluntly-copied/ without any reverse links or appreciation. The site even claimed it to be their original creation. Well, I wasn't angry but flattered. However, I was a bit annoyed too which let to the decision that every of my themes, designs where ever possible, I'll make them opensource or free for people to use them. This will make it obvious that you don't need to copy or claim that it is yours. Why don't you just use it freely.<br />
<br />
A good visitor to my site and a big fan of our "KISS Theme (Kiss Theme)":http://blog.oinam.com/archives/2006/02/oinams-kiss-templates-for-movabletype-typepad-livejournal-wordpress/ (for Wordpress, MovableType, LiveJournal, Typepad and recently Blogger) informed me that "a site (Blogging Themes)":http://www.bloggingthemes.com/ is claiming it to be "their original creation (Kiss Theme)":http://www.bloggingthemes.com/template.php?id=0009. They even dare to called it something else -- *OrangeScale*. I've contacted them but with no reply for over a week. Well, so this is a post to let people know that my themes, templates, styles are free to use and no need to copy. I'm definitely not furious with *Blogging Themes*, I just want people who can contact them to inform them that the Template, Theme, Style is free to use and so you can reproduce it there but with an attribution back home to "Oinam (Oinam)":http://www.oinam.com/.</p>
