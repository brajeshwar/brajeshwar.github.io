# MediaTemple did it again, (gs) Grid Server released

My site <del datetime="2007-12-09T08:29:41+00:00">is</del> was hosted with MediaTemple and I've been happy so far. Well the story is funny as I went off and on coupla times in the past but then I decided to stick with them. They're perhaps one of the most professional Hosting Provider I've ever interacted.

(mt) Media Temple's [Grid-Server](http://www.mediatemple.net/webhosting/gs/) is a completely new hosting platform that replaces yesterday's obsolete shared server technology. We've eliminated roadblocks and single points of failure by using hundreds of servers working in tandem for your site, applications, and email. The Grid's on-demand scalability means you'll always be ready for intense bursts of traffic and the growing audience resulting from your online success. All of this power, controlled through our brand new Account-Center, is available today for a price point unmatched by any competing service.

Some of the cool features highlighted on their site;

- Dynamic, clustered scalability - Automatically grows to support any load level. Easily handle traffic spikes with the power of hundreds of servers powering your site.
- Ruby on Rails
- PHP 5 and PostGreSql included besides PHP4 and MySQL
