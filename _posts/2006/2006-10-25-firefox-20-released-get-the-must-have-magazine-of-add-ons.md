<p>Well, the "FTP link (Direct FTP link to Firefox Downloads)":http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/ was seen everywhere and almost everybody in the *little-ahead - techno-sphere* were already playing with the "Release (Firefox 2.0 release Note)":http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/press/mozilla-2006-10-24.html Version of Firefox 2.0 from "Mozilla (Mozilla)":http://www.mozilla.com/ even before the official announcement was made.</p>
<p>Some good points  --</p>
<p>* I don't really open more than about 10 tabs at max and thus the individual close button is a boon.<br />
* I love the realtime spell check.<br />
* The seamless integration of Feeds is another kick-ass feature. You can "customize (Add New RSS Readers or Change the Default Feed Reader)":http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/07/firefox-20-tutorial-add-new-rss.html it to your choice of application to handle the Feeds. For instance, I've defaulted it to "Newsgator (Newsgator)":http://www.newsgator.com/ Online which syncs with "NetNewsWire (NetNewsWire)":http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire for the "Mac (Brajeshwar's Mac)":http://mac.brajeshwar.com/ and "FeedDemon (FeedDemon)":http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=FeedDemon for Windows.</p>
