<p>Let me try if I my site can be of any help for this person who have commented on "this Photo (this Photo)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/113413490/ while it was still with my Gallery setup. I took it for just those comments where people write to get back to them but I think he is very authentic as he have taken the trouble to find my email and mail me now. All the comments from the Gallery installation was lost because of a stupid mistake on my part. Referring back to my post about the Movie "Amu (Amu)":http://www.brajeshwar.com/2005/amu/, he have emailed me again. I'll reproduce the mail (slightly edited to preserve his mail ID, Telephone Number to myself). Please help him if possible to find his friend.</p>

<p>*An Excerpt from the email*</p>
<blockquote><p>My name Kevin Shah friend of Ilham Khan, Benita Singh, Aditi Trivedi, Rohit Malhotra, etc. I am looking for my 1985 batch mate from Jamnabai Narsee School in Juhu.

Our JNS Yahoo group is called JNS85 on which almost all are logged on. You can call me on (I have withheld the phone number here) (Fremont, CA) if you have any whereabouts. I will appreciate your help if you can trace *Atiya Bose* for me thru *Shonali Bose*.</p></blockquote>
<p>*Let us try and help find his friend.* So, *Atiya Bose* aka *Tiya Bose* is the one whom we have to try to find out through the internet.</p>
