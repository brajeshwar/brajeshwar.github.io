<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/157879014/"><img src="/static/2006/06/kaavyaviswanathan.jpg" alt="Kaavya Viswanathan" class="alignright" /></a>Well, I decided to read the book after her plagiarism episode. "How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got A Life (How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got A Life)":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316059889/002-8253968-5325617?v=glance&n=283155, the book authored by Kaavya Viswanathan is about a young teenager, Opal Mehta, who along with her parents would do anything to get to Havard. The books involves around how Opal Mehta and her parents did everything in their capacity to make up for the only missing links in Opal's life - "To Get a Life". Kaavya Viswanathan the $500,000 sophomore at Harvard, was supposed to have her book turned into a movie by Steven Spielberg this year but it looks like it is not the case anymore.</p>
