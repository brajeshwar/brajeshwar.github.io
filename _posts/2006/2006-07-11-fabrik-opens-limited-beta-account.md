# Fabrik opens limited beta account

[Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/10/fabrik-media-storage-opens-limited-beta-accounts-today/) reported of the limited beta account opening at [Fabrik](http://www.myfabrik.com/).

Online storage is good; giving your data to a company that specializes in keeping data secure and backed up makes sense when it comes to things like family or artistic photos and video. Storage and bandwidth are so cheap now that leveraging economies of scale enables these vendors to offer storage and delivery as a commodity. Fabrik media storage plans will start at $3 per month for 2 GB of data storage with unlimited transfers.

Company CEO and co-founder Mike Cordano came from storage provider [Maxtor](http://www.maxtorsolutions.com/), now a [Seagate](http://www.seagate.com/) company. Chairman and co-founder [Keyur Patel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/tags/keyurpatel/) came from Maxtor as well, following time as Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer at Inktomi Corporation (a Yahoo! acquisition).
