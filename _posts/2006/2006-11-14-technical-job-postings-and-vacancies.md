excerpt: I've blogged about our own team's requirements but never for other people.
  However, of late, the influx of details about Job/Post Vacancies have been accumulating
  up on my inbox and I've been seriously thinking to have a category to post articles
  relating the same. I've been redirecting the recruiters, companies to appropriate
  sources where they can get the right people. Being a blog read by technical people,
  I feel it is apt to write articles about Technical Job Postings and Vacancies. Below
  is one for a start.
