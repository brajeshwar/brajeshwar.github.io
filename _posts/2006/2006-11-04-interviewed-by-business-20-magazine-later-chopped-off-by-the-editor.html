<p>I was confused, yet excited on the evening of 21st October, 2006. The reason was that an editor-at-large of Business 2.0, "Eric Shonfeld (Eric Shonfeld)":http://business2.blogs.com/business2blog/ will interview me. Though it was not for some high profile work or anything like that but the very fact of being interviewed by "Business 2.0 (Business 2.0)":http://business2.blogs.com/ was enough to give me the *hibadi-gibadi* feeling. Eric called me on my Mobile (I think he called me from his hotel room somewhere in London) and he started off casually making me feel extremely easy answering back. It was a quick one which lasted for just about 15 minutes or so. The interview was a small part of a big article that was supposed to come out in November of Business 2.0 Print Magazine and of course the Online version. Unfortunately, I learnt that my interview along with some other part was chopped off. There goes my luck! Anyway, I think I am not yet *that-good-enough* to gaurantee such good things. I will try to strive further ahead towards my goal with the hope that more better things are in store in the near future.<br />
