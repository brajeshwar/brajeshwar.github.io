<p>I honestly did not know that My Site was included in the Flash Timeline, Adobe never told me. I was interviewing a Designer/Developer for CSS/XHTML and he told me that he felt good talking to me. He saw my name on the "Flash Timeline (Flash Timeline)":http://www.adobe.com/go/flashtimeline and asked me to confirm if that was me. I told him, "Well, I do not know, let me check out." I thought, may be he meant the one in the "Adobe Community Experts (Adobe Community Experts)":http://www.adobe.com/communities/experts/. I had checked Flash Timeline before but not that close to look at each and every screen, frame, text, word, link!</p>
<p>After finishing up the telephonic interview with the candidate. I double checked "Flash Timeline (Flash Timeline)":http://www.adobe.com/go/flashtimeline, clicked on the "Click to Launch" link and watch over the whole interaction and of course, I saw my name mentioned yet again by Adobe. It is in the year 2001, they even have that red glow thingy glowing over *Mumbai, India* to mark my location. However, I am not sure how did they dig up the text describing my site. I think I had that long back and it did strike back good memories of the time when I started off with Flash.</p>
