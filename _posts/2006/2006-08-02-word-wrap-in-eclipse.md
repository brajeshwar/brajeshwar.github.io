# Word Wrap in Eclipse

It is still very buggy but we can live with it; you can enable <a href="http://ahtik.com/blog/projects/eclipse-word-wrap/">Word Wrap in Eclipse</a>. It screws up the line number, line height, etc but they will get back to their normal state once you turn off Virtual Word Wrap.

## How to install?

1. Open Eclipse
1. Help > Software Updates > Find and Install
1. Search for New Features to Install
1. New Remote Site
1. Enter the url - http://ahtik.com/eclipse-update/
1. Install and Enjoy

It is available as a context-sensitive Menu "Virtual Word Wrap".
