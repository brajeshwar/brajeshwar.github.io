# Corporate trends in ActionScript codes?

We were reviewing few ActionScript codes of bunch of developers. It so happened while looking at a group of codes from about 4-5 developers; they looked very similar. We realized that;

- they don't really love whitespace at all
- have abusive usage of eval (it should be avoided as it is already deprecated)
- lots of mc1.mc2.mc3.mc4. type of code (can be avoided by coding to interfaces and letting each entity perform its action and access it through a public API)

Well, they were all from the same corporate/company. So, we were thinking if corporate/company have  a tendency or wavelength of coding habits, standards and (bad) practices. Anyway, we have to live with the fact that they can be trained and make them realize what we do and what we should do.
