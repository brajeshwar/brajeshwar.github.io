# del.icio.us direc.tor

It is best to experience this cool application yourself, so, I will just extract some excerpts from their own words below. 

[del.icio.us direc.tor](http://johnvey.com/features/deliciousdirector/) is a web-based rich UI for [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/). It leverages the XML and XSL services of modern browsers to deliver a responsive interface for managing user accounts with a large number of records.

The main features are;
