India was supposed to screen [The Da Vinci Code](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382625/) along with the world on May 19, 2006 but due to the controversy, it was decided that the movie can be screened but with a [disclaimer](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1539951.cms) at the beginning and at the end of the movie that the characters are fictious, and the movie is a work of fiction. Well, that delayed the movie release by a week. Finally, The Da Vinci Code is being released in India today (May 26, 2006).

Yesterday late in the evening, I went to see the preview screening of The [Da Vinci Code](http://www.davincicode.com/) and found the movie good against all the not-so-good reviews that abounds the internet. Nonetheless, I felt that it was a bit slow-paced.

I felt Tom Hanks (who played the famed symbologist Professor Robert Langdon) did not get much chance of displaying his versatile acting skill in this movie. Having read the book earlier, I was perhaps expecting the movie to deliver more. Anyway, the movie was a good-to-see movie.
