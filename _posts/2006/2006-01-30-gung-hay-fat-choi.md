# Gung Hay Fat Choi

Besides the <a href="/2005/scary-mandarin-nightmare/">spammy development</a>, I realized that I have been having more interactions with Chinese though not necessarily with the people living in China. Be it client, interested business associates or newly-found friends, there have been lots of Asians that I have interacted.

A client-turned-business-partner wished me `Gung Hay Fat Choi` the other day and I am told it meant Happy New Year. So, here am I wishing everybody in general and the Chinese in particular `Gung Hay Fat Choi`.
