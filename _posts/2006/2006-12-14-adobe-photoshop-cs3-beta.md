<p><a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/photoshopcs3/"><img src="/static/2006/12/photoshop-cs3-red-pill.jpg" alt="Adobe Photoshop CS3 - Red Pill" style="border: 0 none;" /></a>Adobe have been working to deliver native performance to customers using Intel-based Macs as soon as possible. Now that they believed that their beta, popularly known as Red Pill, is running well on these and other systems, Adobe have decided that it is time to share it with all current Photoshop customers.</p>
<p>So that Windows folks aren't left out, Adobe is posting both Windows and Mac (Intel & PowerPC) builds of Photoshop. "Adobe Photoshop CS3 Beta (Adobe Photoshop CS3 Beta)":http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/photoshopcs3/ popularly known as the Red Pill in its beta is now out on "Adobe Labs (Adobe Labs)":http://labs.adobe.com/ as a Public Beta. The final product is expected to be launched in Spring 2007.<br />
<!--more--><br />
It may be noted that *Photoshop CS3 is no substitute for Photoshop CS2*. It's unfinished, and *you need to own CS2* to use it. Adobe is releasing CS3 as an extension of CS2, as a service to Photoshop customers who've been eagerly awaiting native performance. It is done so as not to confused customers and not purchase CS2 because they think CS3 is just around the corner, or that the beta is a substitute. If you need Photoshop, CS2 is the product to buy. The beta can be downloaded and installed by anyone who creates an "Adobe user ID (Adobe user ID)":http://www.adobe.com/go/gn_your_account, but to make it run beyond a 2-day trial period, you need to enter a CS3 beta serial number. The beta software is available in English only, but you can enter a serial from any language version of CS2 (including Suites, Production Studio, and Web and Video bundles).</p>
<p>*What is Adobe Photoshop CS3 Beta?*<br />
Adobe Photoshop CS3 is the next version of Adobe Photoshop software, the professional standard in digital imaging.

<p>*Who is eligible for the Photoshop CS3 beta?*<br />
The Photoshop CS3 beta is available in English only but to Photoshop CS2 users worldwide. It is available to licensed users of either the Photoshop CS2 (full, upgrade, and education), Adobe Creative Suite 2.x Standard or Premium (full, upgrade, and education), Adobe Production Studio Standard and Premium (full, upgrade, and education), Adobe Video Bundle (full, upgrade, and education) or Adobe Web Bundle (full, upgrade, and education). You will need to provide your Photoshop CS2, Creative Suite, Production Studio or Bundle serial number in order to get a Photoshop CS3 beta serial number, enabling you to activate the Photoshop beta and use it beyond the 2-day grace period.</p>
<p>*What's new in the Photoshop CS3 beta?*<br />
Adobe's primary reason for releasing this beta version is to allow Macintosh customers to run Photoshop natively on the latest Intel based systems, but Adobe assumes that all of their customers will enjoy exploring the application and seeing some of the new features.

<p>*Is the Photoshop CS3 beta feature set complete?*<br />
By definition, a beta is not the final build of a product. Since the Photoshop CS3 software is far along in its development cycle, there will not be time to incorporate feature feedback from this public beta into the final release. However, engineering and testing work on Photoshop CS3 will be ongoing until the launch in spring 2007, and feature suggestions gathered during the public beta may still influence future releases of the software.</p>
<p>*If I make a feature suggestion about the Photoshop CS3 beta, will I see it in the shipping product?*<br />
The timing of this release is such that the plans for Photoshop CS3 are already set. Adobe is always eager to hear what users think, however, and feedback will be considered for future versions of Photoshop.</p>
<p>*Will there be updates to the Photoshop CS3 beta before the final product ships?*<br />
Adobe do not plan any additional beta releases for Photoshop CS3 before it is announced and ships.</p>
<p>*When will the Adobe Photoshop CS3 beta expire?*<br />
The Photoshop CS3 beta will expire soon after the launch of Photoshop CS3 in spring 2007.</p>
<p>*Will the Photoshop CS3 beta be available in languages other than English?*<br />
No. The Photoshop CS3 beta however is available to licensed Photoshop CS2 users worldwide.</p>
<p>*Will I get a discount on Photoshop CS3 if I download the Photoshop CS3 Beta?*<br />
There are no discounts planned for Photoshop CS3 Beta users.</p>
<p>*If I buy Photoshop CS today in order to get access to the Photoshop CS3 beta, will I get a free upgrade to Photoshop CS3?*<br />
No. The rich feature set and productivity enhancements of Photoshop CS2 already provide a strong upgrade value, and the opportunity to preview the upcoming CS3 release is an additional bonus. In addition, customers who are still using Photoshop version 6.0 or earlier will benefit from taking advantage of a more liberal upgrade policy for "Photoshop CS2 (Photoshop CS2)":http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/. Adobe will *not offer upgrade pricing more than three versions back on Photoshop CS3*.</p>
