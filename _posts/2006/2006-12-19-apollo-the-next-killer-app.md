<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/apollo"><img src="/static/2006/12/apollo.jpg" alt="Apollo" /></a>Today, Apollo caught my undivided attention when I saw the post from a *Rich Inter Application Mountaineer*, "Ryan Stewart (Ryan Stewart)":http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/. Ryan wrote about "How eBay is developing with Adobe's Apollo (How eBay is developing with Adobe's Apollo)":http://blogs.zdnet.com/Stewart/?p=197. Ryan talks about *San Dimas*, an experimental Apollo powered project from the eBay Developers and "EffectiveUI (EffectiveUI)":http://www.effectiveui.com/.</p>
<p>_San Dimas uses Apollo and it can take advantage of the desktop and provide awesome capabilities (unlike a typical Flash Application) like local storage and desktop notifications very easily. Alan Lewis, the technical evangelist of San Dimas, mentioned that one of the big advantages of the desktop model is improved caching. For instance there is a web service call to go out and grab the entire tree structure of eBay's categories. In XML format, this is about a 20 meg download. With Apollo, it can be called this once and cache it on the local machine so that the application never has to make the calls to get subcategories. This means fewer calls to the server and better performance._<br />

Michael Arrington of "TechCrunch (TechCrunch)":http://www.techcrunch.com/ on his article titled "Preparing For Apollo (Preparing For Apollo)":http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/16/preparing-for-apollo/ wrote about how Apollo will allow developers to take RIAs, whether they be built on Flash, HTML, JavaScript and/or Ajax, and turn them into desktop applications. Listen to "his interview (Podcast Interview of Kevin Lynch)":http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/12/16/here-comes-adobe-apollo/ (37 mins) with "Kevin Lynch (Kevin Lynch)":http://www.klynch.com/, Adobe's senior vice president and chief software architect.</p>
<p>"Mike Chambers (Mike Chambers)":http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mesh/ have a "10 minute Video (Apollo Interview Video)":http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2840522561992638726&hl=en Interview/Discussion with Christian Cantrell of the Apollo team. You can "download the high resolution version (high resolution Apollo Video)":http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mesh/files/apollo/christian_interviewp_12_15_2006.mp4 of the video (~100MB).</p>
<p>I just downloaded the High Resolution Video and its awesome. "Christian (Christian Cantrell)":http://weblogs.macromedia.com/cantrell/ showed how he integrated Google Maps, which is online, with the Address and Contacts on his Desktop, which is offline (this is freaking awesome). Look at how he drags from the Flex Content to the HTML content. Watch carefully and you will realize that he is using Flex Builder on his Mac and a "Mighty Mouse (Mighty Mouse)":http://odetoapple.com/2006/10/apple-wireless-mighty-mouse/ too. ;-) And yes, we want Multiple Native Windows and synchronous ActionScript - Javascript integration. Here are "some screenshots (Apollo Screenshots)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/sets/72157594321332291/ if you can't wait for your video to download.
