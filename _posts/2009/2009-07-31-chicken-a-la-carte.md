This short film is about the hunger and poverty brought about by Globalization. There are thousands people dying everyday due to hunger and malnutrition. This short film shows a forgotten portion of the society. The people who live on the refuse of men to survive. What is inspiring is the hope and spirituality that never left this people.

Ferdinand Dimadura's short film -- <a href="http://www.cultureunplugged.com/play/1081/Chicken-a-la-Carte">Chicken À la Carte</a> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1826630/">imdb</a>) -- will surely leave you spellbound.
