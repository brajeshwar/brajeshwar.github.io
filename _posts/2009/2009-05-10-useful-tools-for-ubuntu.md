<p>With the advent of the latest release of probably the most preferred Linux distro, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/904overview">Ubuntu 9.04</a> (Jaunty Jackalope), life for a lot of has become simpler. I have been loving the changelog that Ubuntu team works on. With their six-monthly release schedule they come back with better UI, support for new technologies, newer kernel, etc. You may wish to check out the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/904features/">scintillating features</a> of the latest release.</p>
<p>I wonder if a lot of reader know the Ubuntu philosophy which says "<em>I am what I am because of who we all are</em>". Ubuntu, from its birth has focused on providing a stable, user friendly and easy to install and up to date operating system.</p>
<p>What adds to the glory is the availability of numerous free applications that help you do most of what you'll need to pay for on a alternative operating system.</p>
<p><em>The following are a few useful tools which make life simpler;</em></p>
<p># <strong>APTonCD</strong> - A tool that can be used to create local repositories for the various downloaded files from the web keeping the dependencies on a DVD/CD intact. This also permits the installation of these packages on another installation without the usage of internet.<br />
# <strong>CheckGmail</strong> - One of the easiest and smallest tool that positions itself in the taskbar and notifies a user whenever there is a new Gmail in the mailbox! On clicking the small notification window, the default browser leads you to Gmail.<br />
# <strong>Ubuntu Tweak</strong> - With the use of wizard based easy to use interface, this tools helps in easy configuration of Ubuntu. This makes a lot of tedious tasks simpler. A must have for noobs.<br />
# <strong>3UNetbootin</strong> - Well known as Universal NetBoot Installer. It eases the installation on either a HDD partition or a USB drive. Another point worth noting down is that it is available both on Linux and Windows platform.<br />
# <strong>GSmartControl</strong> - Control and monitor storage systems by using Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) which is built in ATA and SCSI hard-disks. By installing this tool, various information about the Hard Disk Drive such as its state, degradation and other parameters is made available for easy viewing. </p>
<p>You may use the inbuilt package manager to search and install these applications with a few mouse clicks.</p>
<p>I could find a lot of other interesting tools as well which help optimizing your Linux installation with their powerful-yet-simple UI. Most of these tools intend to improve the overall performance of the system.</p>
<p>Another key concern for novice users is the presence of hacking element which tend to create vulnerability.
