# Get free WinAutomation License Professional Edition

I don't use Windows, so I had totally brushed aside the offer of 4 free Professional licenses of WinAutomation. However, I felt it should be useful to Windows users who visit my site. So, here you go -- stand a chance to win a WinAutomation license Professional Edition (I've got 4 licenses to give away).

## What do you need to do?
