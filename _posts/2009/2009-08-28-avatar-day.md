# Avatar Day

It was an awesome experience. India had its Avatar Day today, where few movie theaters preview 20 minutes of [Avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)) movie in 3D including the theatrical trailer. Avatar is expected to release worldwide on 18th December, 2009.

Avatar (originally a Hindu term for the incarnation of a higher being) is the latest of James Cameron's dramatic feature since Titanic (1997), displaying the creative possibilities both of 3D and motion-capture production techniques.

## The Avatar Story

Jake Sully (Sam Worthington of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438488/">Terminator Salvation</a> fame), is a former Marine who was wounded and paralyzed from the waist down in combat. Jake is selected to participate in the Avatar program, which will enable him to take over an Avatar. Jake travels to Pandora, a lush jungle-covered extraterrestrial moon filled with incredible life forms, some beautiful, many terrifying.

Pandora is also home to the Na'vi, a sentient humanoid race that humans consider primitive, yet are more physically capable than humans. Standing three meters tall, with tails and sparkling blue skin, the Na'vi live in harmony with their unspoiled world. As humans encroach deeper into Pandora's forests in search of valuable minerals, the Na'vi unleash their formidable warrior abilities to defend their threatened existence.

Since humans are unable to breathe the air on Pandora, they have created genetically-bred human-Na'vi hybrids known as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/">Avatars</a>. The Avatars are living, breathing bodies that are controlled by a human "driver" through a technology that links the driver's mind to their Avatar body. On Pandora, through his Avatar body, Jake can be whole once again. Sent deep into Pandora's jungles as a scout for the soldiers that will follow, Jake encounters many of Pandora's beauties and dangers. There he meets a young Na'vi female, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana).

Over time, Jake integrates himself into Neytiri's clan, and begins to fall in love with her. As a result, Jake finds himself caught between the military-industrial forces of Earth, and the Na'vi, forcing him to choose sides in an epic battle that will decide the fate of an entire world.
