<p>Everybody loves <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> and we've been integrating Twitter with oCricket in a way. Recently, we decided to give it a shot of steroid and we are happy to announce a <a href="http://ocricket.com/talk/">Cricket enhanced Twitter</a> spin-off on oCricket.</p>
<p><a href="http://ocricket.com/talk/"><img src="/static/2009/03/ocricket-talk-keyword.png" alt="Cricket related keywords on Twitter" style="border: 0 none; float: right; margin: 0 0 5px 5px;" /></a><a href="http://ocricket.com/talk/">The app</a> is powered by the user, which means, users suggest a keyword and is voted by other users. Once a keyword becomes <strong>hot</strong> enough, we track it and is relayed for other users to enjoy the Twitter Experience on a single interface where others can reply there, relayed back to their Twitter timeline. A user can also vote against a keyword and we stop tracking it goes below its hotness level.</p>
<p>Enjoy the <a href="http://ocricket.com/talk/">Cricket Talk</a>. Tell us what you feel, where can we improve to make your Twitter-Cricket experience a better one. We're expecting that Cricket Talk will be a way easier way to track Cricket on Twitter and be amongst other Cricket fans across the globe.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please keep the keyword suggestion to Cricket related ones (I know you can suggest anything!) And yes, we use Twitter's brand new <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/OAuth-FAQ">OAuth</a>, so you won't have to disclose your Username/Password to our application.</p>
