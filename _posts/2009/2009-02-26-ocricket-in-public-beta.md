<p>If you haven't noticed, I'm involved with <a href="http://ocricket.com/">oCricket</a>, a Startup which is trying to bring a new paradigm to the world of Cricket, its fans and followers alike. After our initial hiccups and shake-up in the team, we're finally ready for Public Beta. We lifted the embargo sometime back on 14th Feb, 2009 after a presentational demo at <a href="http://mumbai.startupsaturday.in/">Startup Saturday, Mumbai</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is oCricket?</strong></p>
<p>oCricket is a user-focussed site, poised to be an instant reflection of all cricketing events.  We know there are many popular <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Cricket">Cricket</a> sites. We also know that Cricket is so popular, that there is always something about Cricket in everything - Cricket-this, Cricket-that. Nonetheless, we felt the need for a site where everyone can get involved unlike other popular Cricket sites where news and information are shoved down the user's way via one-way traffic and medium.</p>
<p>We wanted a social network but with just Cricket in mind. <a href="http://ocricket.com/">oCricket</a> is geared towards an environment where everybody can contribute, browse through articles, linked write-ups from other sites, photos, videos etc. We loved the idea of users being able to weigh the importance of news and information bits via voting, ability to plug-in their views, comments and discuss on anything about Cricket. oCricket will allows users to interact with one another easily, be social and meet their Cricketing peers online. It will serve as a Social Network site for Cricket.</p>
<p><strong>What's more?</strong></p>
<p>oCricket is always in active development and we've plans for some interesting modules for the immediate future. We believe users will find the upcoming modules enjoyable and worthwhile.</p>

<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>
<p>Before starting oCricket, I was involved with Mixercast, another Startup that operates in the Media segment, widgets and advertisement.</p>
<p><a href="http://freegeek.in/blog/">Baishampayan Ghose</a>, is the Computer Nerd who co-founded oCricket.  He uses & writes <a href="http://github.com/ghoseb/">Free and Open Source Software</a>, microblogs on <a href="http://twitter.com/ghoseb/">Twitter</a>. And oh, <a href="http://www.notadouche.com/users/baishampayan_ghose">he is not a douche</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://atifhaider.com/">Aatif Haider</a> and <strong>Harsh Kohli</strong> calls themselves the Code Monkeys and/or snake charmers. At times, they do wish they were the Bicycle Repairman.</p>
<p>Some of the things the team enjoys most, besides Cricket, are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars">Star Wars</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python">Monty Python</a> and few other weird stuffs.</p>
<p><strong>Finally,</strong></p>
<p>Visit and check out <a href="http://ocricket.com/">oCricket</a>. We'd love to get your feedbacks, criticisms, eggs, tomatoes, shoes and everything else in between.</p>
