I will always have a soft corner heart for Bombay[^bombay]. Ten years ago on Aug 2, 2009, I landed in Bombay and that made all the difference.

For that boy from a small town in the extreme edge of India, Bombay was a fascinating city.

` A work-in-progress.`

[^bombay]: [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai), erstwhile Bombay, is the capital city of Maharashtra, India. Mumbai is the financial capital and the most populous city of India.
