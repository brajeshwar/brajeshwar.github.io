</div>

<p>I've been briefed about the rules, regulations and details where Nokia will give out 10 Nokia N97 as part of the <a href="/2009/nokia-search-for-n/">Search for N</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is 'Search for N'?</strong></p>
<p>Nokia have hidden 97 New Nokia N97s Across 13 Countries and is giving them away, for free, before they hit the shelves in-store. The only catch is, they're hidden across 13 countries and the only way to find them is to crack five cryptic clues online.</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine being able to test drive the advanced multi-media, multi-sensory mobile device to date before anyone else, and knowing that only 96 other people around the globe were part of the same exclusive 'Search for N' winners club; all of whom solved the Nokia clues and discovered a new Nokia N97 before anyone else.</p></blockquote>
<p>Running over a period of seven days, in advance of the Nokia N97 going on sale worldwide, the 'Search for N' clues will be released on the exact same date and time across each country. Five clues will be asked on the site which could relate to news that week, feature aspects of the new Nokia N97, or include clever cryptic clues that encourage consumers to explore content online.</p>
<p>Once contestants successfully answer all five clues the race is then on to locate a hidden Nokia N97 device -- either in a physical location, or online. Only 96 other people around the globe will have the chance to find a Nokia N97 before anyone else, and join a 'Search for N' winners club which will span three continents.</p>
