<p>The trends in the IT market have changed consistently with time. Today, technology becomes obsolete faster than ever before. Open source has become an evolution in itself. The presence of Linux and its role in market is difficult to predict as the computing market is exploding today. Experts like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cox">Alan Cox</a> are sure about its sustainability and say, </p>
<blockquote><p>Linux has good security features which makes it ideal for things like call center environments. Building a thin client Linux environment with hotdesking, sensible shared file store and good network efficiency is a golden opportunity.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The major advantages that Linux has are;</strong></p>
<p>* Linux is considered to do well as a server operating system.<br />
* It performs effectively both on the thin clients and embedded environments.<br />
* It is doing a great job for desktop users as well.<br />
* A lot of GUI environments are made available for the end users.<br />
* Linux is stable, versatile and can run on older hardware as well.</p>
<p>If you have been following our <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/category/technology/linux/">open source series</a>, you would have come across our article on the <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/2008/choose-linux-over-windows-vista/">Linux advantage</a>, a few months back.</p>
<p>Linux has created a buzz in the recent past and has picked up the segment of people who trust open source and love the Linux community. The future of Linux can be predicted based on the fact that it stands to provide its users the features they looking for. Be it Wi-Fi compatibility, games, intuitive UI, <em>et al</em>. Flexibility and robust security features enhance its potential. Linux appears fit to be a generic OS for the embedded system and servers. Linux also fulfills several roles in the commercial space. It supervises Windows NT boxes and also reboots them when required, used as image server for bulk installation of PCs, network monitoring and many more.</p>
<p>Linux being Open Source operating systems has emerged from a clique phenomenon driven by thousands of programmers worldwide. A lot of companies are now focusing on finding different ways to build their offerings around the Linux system. The new Linux community will now need to deal with the surfaced challenges as they are establishing a lucrative commercial environment. </p>
<p>The majority still believes in the thought that MS-Windows and/or Mac based systems are in a better frame to provide what one needs. It would be difficult to say which is the best OS in the market but Linux is no doubt one of the best choices for an enterprise operating system.  Moreover, its use as a home PC has been expanding rapidly. Typical advantages of Linux include low cost, built-in networking, scalability, high performance, speed and reliability. </p>
<p>Linux is heading towards the right target market which consists of techies, learners and people who love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS">FOSS</a>. It provides them with the environment that suits them the best. Linux, therefore, is a basis for a cost effective OS providing robust network and system management capabilities.</p>
