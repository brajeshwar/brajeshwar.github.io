# “How to Write” — 10 Pieces of Timeless Advice by David Ogilvy

David Ogilvy[^Ogilvy] sent out a memo on Sep 7, 1982, directing it to everyone employed at Ogilvy & Mather.

The better you write, the higher you will go. People who think well, write well. Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well.

The memo was entitled “How to Write” and consisted of the following list of advice:

1. Read the Roman-Raphaelson book on writing.[^WritingThatWorks] Read it three times.
2. Write the way you talk. Naturally.
3. Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs.
4. Never use jargon words like _reconceptualize_,[^Reconceptualize] _demassification_,[^Demassification] _attitudinally_,[^Attitudinally] _judgmentally_.[^Judgmentally] They are hallmarks of a pretentious ass.
5. Never write more than two pages on any subject.
6. Check your quotations.
7. Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning—and then edit it.
8. If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it.
9. Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do.
10. If you want ACTION, don’t write. Go and tell the guy what you want.
