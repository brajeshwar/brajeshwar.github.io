During a recent meeting with [Saneef](https://saneef.com), one topic was why and how he created a [website for his 7-year-old kid](https://saneef.com/blog/website-for-my-7-year-old-kids-drawings/). Back home, I showed the website to my daughter (they are the same age).

“Why don’t I have my own website too?”

√ [Please check out Amara’s Art](https://amara.oinam.art).

[Shiro’s website](https://shiro.ws) is [open source](https://github.com/saneef/shiro.ws), but I was not ready for the “simplicity” that Saneef created. I decided to copy the idea and some core styles and created a website for my 7-year-old daughter.

I kept the website as [plain as possible](https://github.com/oinam/amara.oinam.art). It is powered by Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages with Cloudflare in the front. As usual, these websites are never finished. I will continue to tweak it and tinker.
