# Midori

I love writing with a pen on paper. About a year ago, I stumbled on [Midori](https://www.midori-japan.co.jp/english/), and I was blown away by the quality of their paper.

Midori Notebook are clean, calm, and focused. Their minimalist approach ensures the notebook doesn’t overshadow its primary purpose: to serve as a canvas for thoughts, plans, and creativity.

The attention to detail in their construction is unmistakable. The paper edges are carefully trimmed, and the bindings are robust yet unobtrusive. This allows the notebook to lay flat—an essential feature for writers and artists alike.

Midori MD paper is highly versatile, accommodating a range of writing tools, from fountain pens to pencils and gel pens. Significantly, it minimizes ink bleed-through and feathering, making it a favorite among fountain pen enthusiasts. The slightly off-white tone of the paper is gentle on the eyes, offering a vintage charm while ensuring readability.
