# The Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential

Do you believe in doing something to change the world and hopefully “put a dent in the universe?” Many people ask this question, but they are lost on what big impactful thing they can do.

Indeed, there are philosophical ways to approach this question, and as always, the answer is unique to each of us. It’s about aligning our actions with our values, leveraging our skills and resources, and making a positive impact in our own way.

For those seeking a starting point, [The Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential](http://encyclopedia.uia.org/) is a readily accessible resource that can empower you to make informed decisions.

The Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential is a unique, experimental research work of the Union of International Associations. It is currently published as a searchable online platform with profiles of world problems, action strategies, and human values interlinked in novel and innovative ways. These connections are based on various relationships, such as broader and narrower scope, aggravation, relatedness, and more. By concentrating on these links and relationships, the Encyclopedia is uniquely positioned to bring focus to the complex and expansive sphere of global issues and their interconnected nature.

The Encyclopedia is a free, open-source, public resource that contains profiles of more than 56,000 world problems, 31,000 action strategies, 3,200 Human Value profiles, and more.
