# On Deck - Builders Merge Grant

[Merge Grant](https://odteam.notion.site/Merge-Grant-7eadfac121ae45328c80cd3a733fb2ab) is a micro-grant initiative designed to give ambitious builders resources as they pursue compelling projects. It is run by [Merge Club](https://merge.club) members—called Mergers—who review applications, conduct interviews, and make grant decisions.

They take no equity, ownership, or future right to invest. You get perks and an invite to join the Merge Club.

The awesome people at [On Deck](https://beondeck.com/r/brajeshwar) back the Merge Grant initiative.
