# It Depends

As I’ve grown older I have developed a heuristic, which is that people who talk/write like this, i.e. being completely convinced that one way of doing things is always wrong and one way of doing things is always right, and that people doing things the other way are just ignorant/stupid/wrong, usually have no idea what they are talking about.

The best advice I got early in my career on this topic was: “Nobody serious is going to take you seriously if you give one option as the ‘way it has to be.’ Everything has trade-offs, you will be much more effective as a communicator if you list a few options, along with their trade-offs (and be honest about these). You can even have your preferred / recommended option but it also must come with trade-offs.”

My approach is to have strong opinions (weakly held), and ask if people have objections to the tradeoffs. That tends to keep the focus on specific reasons to choose a given path rather than you and someone else just having different preferences. Doesn't always work, but it's a lot easier than fighting over whether option A or option B is just universally better.
