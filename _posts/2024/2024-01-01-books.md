[Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_War:_The_Fight_for_the_World%27s_Most_Critical_Technology) by [Chris Miller](https://www.christophermiller.net), an economic historian, explains how the semiconductor came to play a critical role in modern life and how the USA become dominant in chip design and manufacturing and applied this technology to military systems. The book focuses on the military power of the USA, especially during the Cold War. It highlights the current rise of chip power by China, Taiwan, Korea, and Europe. This fascinating book paints the current state of politics, economics, and technology and shows how the “chip” plays a vital role.

Integrated Circuit (IC), also known as a microchip, aka the computer chip, or simply the “chip,” is in virtually everything—from humble microwaves to phones to the most complex military devices. The world’s military, economic, and geopolitical power is built on a foundation of computer chips.

My daughters are fascinated by strange things. Of course, the younger one is influenced by what her sister does. Five years ago, the elder one asked me to get [Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwaidan%3A_Stories_and_Studies_of_Strange_Things) by [Lafcadio Hearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafcadio_Hearn). I started reading it, and left it. This year, I decided to finish reading the stories. Kwaidan (怪談) is a 1904 ghost storybook that features several Japanese ghost stories. It gave birth to the Oscar®-nominated 1964 Japanese anthology horror film, [Kwaidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwaidan_(film)) by [Masaki Kobayashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaki_Kobayashi). It was a quick read and easy to sneak in between other books and finish off in a couple of days.

[The Power of Future Machines: Essays on Artificial Intelligence](https://www.rajivmalhotra.com/product/the-power-of-future-machines) by [Rajiv Malhotra](https://www.rajivmalhotra.com), TN Sudarshan, and Manogna Sastry. This is one of those book that I usually read when nothing was around. I bought it while waitiing for a friend to catch up over tea. The book is a collection of snippets, interviews, and rambling from people who some relationship with Artificial Intelligence. Anyways, who isn’t these days! Stored and kept, and won’t read it again. Personally, it is just not my type of book.

[The TATAS: How a Family Built a Business and a Nation](https://www.amazon.com/Tatas-Family-Built-Business-Nation/dp/9352779371) by [Girish Kuber](https://mr.wikipedia.org/wiki/गिरीश_कुबेर), and English translation by Vikrant Pande. This was a quick and fast read for me. The book is not Walter Isaacson style writing of a person or a family, but more of a time-series snapshots of the family of the TATAS business empire. An interesting read-it-once book.
