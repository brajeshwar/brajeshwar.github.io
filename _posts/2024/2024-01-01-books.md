My daughters are fascinated by strange things. Of course, the younger one is influenced by what her sister does. Five years ago, the elder one asked me to get [Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwaidan%3A_Stories_and_Studies_of_Strange_Things) by [Lafcadio Hearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafcadio_Hearn). I started reading it, and left it. This year, I decided to finish reading the stories. Kwaidan (怪談) is a 1904 ghost storybook that features several Japanese ghost stories. It gave birth to the Oscar®-nominated 1964 Japanese anthology horror film, [Kwaidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwaidan_(film)) by [Masaki Kobayashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaki_Kobayashi). It was a quick read and easy to sneak in between other books and finish off in a couple of days.
