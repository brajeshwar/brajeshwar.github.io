# HotDog from Sausage Software

While still in school in the mid-1990s, I began reading about computers. In one of those computer magazines with the CDs, I got HotDog, which made me get into HTML. I had planned that as soon as I got somewhere with Internet access, I’d try my hands on HTML, and HotDog was my preparation for that journey.

On Aug 2, 1999, I landed in [Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai), leaving my town for good. I had my first interaction with the Internet, but unfortunately, HotDog seemed to have died out by then.

[HotDog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotDog) is an HTML editor developed by [Sausage Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage_Software) in the mid-1990s. At the time of its development, only a few HTML editors were available on the market (such as HoTMetaL), and HotDog gathered significant interest due to its ease of use.

The New Zealand Internet entrepreneur [Steve Outtrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Outtrim) developed the program at Sausage Software.

HotDog and the company became the ‘dotcom darling’ of the Australian media, receiving a large amount of media exposure due to the young age of the company’s founder and staff featuring pinball machines and a pool table in the company’s reception area.

#### Notes

- [India introduced Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_India) to the general public on its Independence Day on Aug 15, 1995. There was no Internet in my hometown in [Manipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur) until about the mid-2000s.
- I realized that the Wikipedia page on Manipur has some of my photos but uploaded by others. I’m sure they got it while my Flickr photos were very active. Let this be. It is nice.
