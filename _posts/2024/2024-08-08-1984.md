[1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) is a dystopian novel and cautionary tale by [George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell). The book was published on Jun 8, 1949 as Orwell’s ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.

> 1984 has had a profound impact on literature and popular culture. Phrases like “Big Brother”, “Double Think”, “Thought Police”, “Thought Crime”, “Newspeak”, and “2 + 2 = 5” have become part of the global lexicon.

The story takes place in an imagined future. The current year is uncertain, but believed to be 1984. Much of the world is in perpetual war. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, which is led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense cult of personality manufactured by the Party’s Thought Police. The Party engages in omnipresent government surveillance and, through the Ministry of Truth, historical negationism and constant propaganda to persecute individuality and independent thinking.

The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a 39-year old mid-level worker at the Ministry of Truth who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He keeps a forbidden diary. He begins a relationship with a colleague, Julia, and they learn about a shadowy resistance group called the Brotherhood. However, their contact within the Brotherhood turns out to be a party agent, and Smith and Julia are arrested. He is subjected to months of psychological manipulation and torture by the Ministry of Love. He ultimately betrays Julia and is released; he finally realises he loves Big Brother.
