# WordPress - a Personal Note

This is a very personal note about my journey with WordPress. This article is here to serve as a history for my association with WordPress. It has nothing to do with any story in and around WordPress in the past, present, or future.

WordPress was released on May 27, 2003, by its founders, [Matt Mullenweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg) and [Mike Little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Little). [WordPress Foundation](https://wordpressfoundation.org) owns WordPress, WordPress projects, and other related trademarks.

My fondest memory of WordPress is that of the times when we needed to have another separate instance of its installation just to get a separate pages, such as an About Page.

I still have my [WordPress profile](https://profiles.wordpress.org/brajeshwar/) listing some of my works. However, a few of my plugins and themes have been sold or transferred.

Every design iteraction of my Website that [ran on WordPress](/2006/brajeshwar-v70-wordpress-theme/) had a theme that were open for free downloads. They were also listed on the [WordPress Theme Viewer](https://wordpress.org/themes/). Others forked, and made [interesting changes](/2006/ajaxified-version-of-brajeshwar-v70-wordpress-theme/) to the theme.

Many publication, such as the Smashing Magazine [included my themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20150802014153/http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/02/83-beautiful-wordpress-themes-you-probably-havent-seen/) as some of the most beautiful WordPress Themes.

Another of my theme, [Nishita](/2006/nishita-photo-blog-theme/), was the craze of that time. On Oct 4, 2011, WordPress.com took over Nishita Photo WordPress Theme and have released a [Photo Theme for WordPress.com](/2011/nishita-photo-theme-on-wordpress-com-another-photography-theme-autochrome-released/).

There were a few plugins that I was part of. One such popular one was [Tiny Link](/2007/tiny-link-wordpress-plugin/) - a Wordpress plugin to create a TinyURL for the posts. The other well-received plugin was [TagThis](/2008/tagthis-wordpress-plugin/).

A simple function of [Numbered Pagination](/2012/how-to-do-numbered-pagination-for-your-wordpress-blog/) design became pretty popular too and people loved it.

I even presented at a WordCamp on to be [Smarter with WordPress Theme Design & Development Workflow with node.js, ruby, sass, bower and grunt](/2014/smarter-wordpress-theme-design-development-workflow-node-js-ruby-sass-bower-grunt/).

And yes, this website was [powered by WordPress for about 18-years](/2021/brajeshwar.com-2021/).

_Disclaimer:_ I was also a long-time WP-Engine customer, and my account was grandfathered forever. Unfortunately, my site moved away from WordPress, so I stopped using them.
