# Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

BLUF[^bluf] (Bottom Line Up Front) is the practice of starting a message with its vital information first. This provides the recipient with the most important information first, making the message more straightforward and more concise.

The basic idea is simple: list the most important details first. Don't tease or delay your main point because people are busy, and their time is valuable. And make it clear—your information could be used to make life-or-death decisions. The idea enforces speed and clarity in delivering the intended messages in reports, emails, or text messages.

Scott Adams of the Dilbert fame [puts it succinctly](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html) that writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Don't fight it.

If you start a text message with “Hi” or “Hello”, follow-up with the context; [don’t be spooky](https://therealadam.com/2021/11/01/dont-be-spooky.html) or call up someone and stop at “hello” - start the conversation - [No Hello](https://nohello.net/). In the old days of online chat, there was a brilliant advice and it makes more sense now than ever — [don't ask to ask, just ask](https://dontasktoask.com).

[^bluf]: [BLUF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)) is a standard in U.S. military communication whose aim is to make military messages precise and powerful. It differs from an older, more-traditional style in which conclusions and recommendations are included at the end, following the arguments and considerations of facts. The BLUF concept is not exclusive to writing since it can also be used in conversations and interviews.
