# Facebook’s Red Book

Facebook’s Red Book is an interesting part of Internet History. Designer [Ben Barry](https://benbarry.com) [created the book](https://v1.benbarry.com/project/facebooks-book) that distilled Facebook’s ethos—breaking things, thinking big, and moving fast—into a manifesto. More than a handbook, it was a declaration of identity, solving the problem of scaling culture during explosive growth. It reminded employees, “This is who we are. This is why we exist.”
