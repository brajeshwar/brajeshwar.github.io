{% include video source="youtube" id="M9oPjIzb0bk" %}

[Bulkr](https://getbulkr.com) is a no-frill, easy to use backup solution for your Flickr Photos. Flickr, an awesome Photo service from Yahoo!, lacks data liberation -- you cannot download your Photos once uploaded. Of course, you can go to each photo to download them but that isn't the right way to do!

## Some of Bulkr's salient features;

- Backup your photo-stream with a click.
- Download your or any user's sets (albums).
- Download photos in 4 different sizes.
- Write title, tags, description, geotag to EXIF.
- Preview images before download.
- Auto resume download if connection breaks.
- Download creative commons photos up to 500 at a go from --
  + Flickr search
  + Your photostream
  + User's photostream (or set)
  + Your favorites
  + Any Flickr group
  + Explored photos

The free version of Bulkr should be pretty enough for most users. However, there are few limitations of the Free version:

- the number of photos you can browse at a time, for instance you can browser someone's photos, groups or explore to just 50 photos.
- download (Backup) all photos except for the original size photo.

## [Bulkr PRO](https://getbulkr.com/pro) has the following extended features;

- Download title, tags, description to photo EXIF.
- Full access to all (creative commons) photos and sets.
- Browse up-to 500 photos per page.
- Access to original photo size.
