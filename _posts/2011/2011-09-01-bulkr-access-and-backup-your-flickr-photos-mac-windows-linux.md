<p>Veronica Belmont, at Tekzilla, on the features and awesomeness of Bulkr.</p>
<p><a href="http://clipyourphotos.com/bulkr/">Bulkr</a> is a no-frill, easy to use backup solution for your Flickr Photos. Flickr, an awesome Photo service from Yahoo!, lacks data liberation -- you cannot download your Photos once uploaded. Of course, you can go to each photo to download them but that isn't the right way to do!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bulkr PRO</strong> (which sells for $40) is available for just 50% on Brajeshwar.com at just $19.99. <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=Z3Z4BUCX8SF8S" title="Buy Bulkr PRO">Buy Bulkr PRO</a> by clicking the Bulkr Banner (look at the top right corner). <em>Valid from Sep 1-15, 2011.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Some of Bulkr's salient features:</h3>
<p>* Backup your photo-stream with a click.<br />
* Download your or any user's sets (albums).<br />
* Download photos in 4 different sizes.<br />
* Write title, tags, description, geotag to EXIF.<br />
* Preview images before download.<br />
* Auto resume download if connection breaks.<br />
* Download creative commons photos up to 500 at a go from --<br />
** Flickr search<br />
** Your photostream<br />
** User's photostream (or set)<br />
** Your favorites<br />
** Any Flickr group<br />
** Explored photos</p>
<p>The free version of Bulkr should be pretty enough for most users. However, there are few limitations of the Free version:</p>
<p>* the number of photos you can browse at a time, for instance you can browser someone's photos, groups or explore to just 50 photos.<br />
* download (Backup) all photos except for the original size photo.</p>
<h3><a href="http://clipyourphotos.com/bulkr/pro">Bulkr PRO</a> have the following extended features:</h3>
<p>* Download title, tags, description to photo EXIF.<br />
* Full access to all (creative commons) photos and sets.<br />

<p>Go ahead, liberate your Photos from Flickr.</p>
