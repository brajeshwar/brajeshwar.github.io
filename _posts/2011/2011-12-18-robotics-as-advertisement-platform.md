Went to <a href="http://jaaga.in/">Jaaga</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/sets/72157628466816453/">photos</a>) today to greet the "Geeks on a Plane". I did a quick video talk with the guy (Shadab) behind 'Shady Robotics', who plans to use Robotics as a platform for Advertisement.
