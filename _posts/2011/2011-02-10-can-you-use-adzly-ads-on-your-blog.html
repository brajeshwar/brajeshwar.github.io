<p>Adzly is a new advertising network that many bloggers have taken advantage of. Google Adsense has traditionally been used for bloggers to promote their sites, but new blogs can sometimes be great opportunities to receive traffic that would otherwise have a lot of competition. However, you can't expect to gain anything from Adzly by cutting and pasting a few quotes from your website. You will need to put some thought into your ad and make sure that it is appealing to your target audience. Hopefully, this is already the core of your marketing strategy.</p>

<h3>How to use Adzly effectively</h3>
<p>A blogger I know says that he hasn't had much success in Adzly yet, but that is his own fault. He prescribes some ideas for <a href="http://www.imfaceplate.com/GTBulmer/how-to-make-the-best-of-adzly-ads">getting the most of their ads</a>. </p>
<p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<p># <strong>Know how to reach your audience.</strong> We all know how useless it is to target keywords in Google that your target audience isn't looking for. I personally spent three months targeting the wrong keywords and didn't get any traffic from them. The same principle applies to any online marketing strategy. With Adzly, you don't have to choose archaic keywords that appeal to your specific audience. All you have to do is choose a general category that they can relate to.<br />
# <strong>Create a call to action!</strong> This means that you will need to write a copy that your readers are going to be drawn to. You will get no conversions if you can't inspire someone to click on your ad.<br />
# <strong>Stay in control.</strong> You will never get anything out of Adzly if you leave it to chance. Internet marketing always requires effort on your part. Luck is almost meaningless.</p>
<h3>Will Adzly really work for you?</h3>
<p>Adzly has two major advantages over Google. First of all, it is a little simpler to target your audience. Choosing from a set of categories is easier than trying to reach a highly targeted keyword. The categories are predetermined for you and you just need to decide which ones best fit your target audience. Secondly, you won't have quite as much competition as Google. The major downside is that you won't have as much exposure.</p>
<h3>Don't expect miracles</h3>
<p>The article I linked to suggests that Adzly is a great advertising venue. I think you can get a lot out of it, but some people are too optimistic with new advertising networks. Personally, I feel that you should do your best to experiment with different networks and get a feel for what works and what doesn't. Optimize your ad strategy effectively and you should have no problem generating relevant traffic.</p>
