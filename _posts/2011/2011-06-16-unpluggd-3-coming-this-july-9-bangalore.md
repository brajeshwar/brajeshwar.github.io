---

One of the very popular Startup and Entrepreneur event, <a href="http://www.pluggd.in/unpluggd/">Unpluggd</a> is being held this July 9th in Bangalore.

The day long event has two broad tracks:

## @Inspirational

Inspiring talks by entrepreneurs (people who-have-been-there-done-that-and-are-still-doing-it) who share their journey   in the most "UnPluggd format". Earlier editions have witnessed entrepreneurs like Naveen Tewari (InMobi), Sachin Bansal (Flipkart), Alok Kejriwal (Games2Win), Manish (Printo), Phanindra Sama (redBus) etc. sharing their startup journey - the journey of rejection/failures and perseverance.

## @DEMO

The selection panel will select the 10 most promising startups that get to demo their product at the event (across industries like Internet,   Mobile, Enterprise, Cleantech etc). Last event witnessed more than 250 nominations, out of which 10 were selected to demo at the event. Given that this comes from Pluggd.in, India's largest visibility platform for startups - expect some amazing startups.
