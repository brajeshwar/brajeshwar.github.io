# Cloud Computing and Phone security!

{% include video source="youtube" id="uLdHnMG4Wlk" %}

A hilarious video of an Indian top brass talking crap about Mobile Phone Security and Cloud Computing. The subtitle is an actual .srt and not etched into the video.

This is my first subtitle done from scratch and may not be perfect. Feel free to contribute, improve on it, or re-produce your own version. A version of the video is included in the Subtitle source file. [Fork it at Github](https://github.com/Brajeshwar/cloud-computing-and-phone-security). Pull Requests are welcome.
