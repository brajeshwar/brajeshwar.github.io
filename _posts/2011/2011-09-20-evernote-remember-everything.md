# Evernote - Remember Everything

I use <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> religiously but never needed the Pro version. The free version of Evernote is more than sufficient and enough for me. However, I've subscribed to the Pro version for quite sometime.

I subscribe to the Pro version because I love this software. It is "love" just as <a href="http://twitter.com/plibin">Phil Libin</a> have emphasized many a times.

Get Evernote, it works everywhere - Desktop, Mobile, Web. Most of you will never need the Pro version, it is perfectly OK to stay with the free version and use it to its full.
