<p>There is a rather complex, long and detailed article on how to <a href="http://www.maxmasnick.com/guides/bulletproof_your_blog/">Bulletproof your blog: a guide for surviving traffic spikes</a>, but for all the other self-hosted Wordpress blogs out there, here is a simple non-geeky solution suited for most of us. You don't need to edit anything, pull or push anything - you've to just worry about your actual writing/blogging.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Note:</em> Recently one of my article, <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/2011/desingineer-the-mythical-person-every-startups-are-looking-for/">Desingineer - the mythical person every Startups are looking for</a>, stayed on the frontpage of HackerNews for about 24 hours and it held up without any problem. Here is the <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/2011/how-is-it-like-during-the-first-hour-when-your-site-is-on-top-of-hackernews/">video</a> of the traffic onslaught.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>Host with a service provider who can scale up when you get a traffic spike. These days, there are Wordpress speciality hosting providers. If yours is Wordpress, why not host with them. I've hosted with both WPEngine and Page.ly and they're equally good - go ahead and pick one.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><em><a href="http://wpengine.com/">WPEngine</a></em></p>
<p>I hosted my own blog when they were starting. They're very good. Some of the best tech geeks, I respect, are behind this company. They know the ins and outs of Wordpress. Unfortunately, my site can no longer afford their price of $199 per month. However, the starting price of $49 may be just fit for most blogs.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://page.ly/">Page.ly</a></em></p>
<p>My site is currently hosted on Page.ly. Their support is super awesome. Their recent upgrade to better infrastructure is well noticed and is showing good signs. My site's uptime is awesome - some 99.99% or so for the last couple of months. Most blogs should be able to take advantage of their starting price of $19.95 per month hosting package and their $49.95 per month is pretty good enough for more popular blogs. If you hit any of the ceiling, they will gently ask you to upgrade to a higher plan.</p>
<p><em>Cache Plugin</em></p>
<p>A must-have for any self-hosted Wordpress blog. Both of the above hosting providers will take care of installing and maintaining a cache plugin they're comfortable with. You don't even have to worry about that. <em>WP Total Cache</em> is a popular one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cloudflare.com/"><img src="/static/2011/12/cloudflare-brajeshwar.png" alt="Cloudflare saves Brajeshwar" class="alignright" /></a></p>
<h3>CloudFlare</h3>
<p>CloudFlare literally reduces everything in half - the spike, the in-coming hits, threats, bandwidths and even the cost. For any decently trafficked self hosted blog, CloudFlare is a very good solution. The free version is good enough. CloudFlare even comes built-in with a robust DNS Manager.</p>
<h3>CDN (Optional)</h3>
<p>Use a CDN for your static assets - images, photos, videos. I use Amazon's Cloudfront for all my static files on separate sub-domains. This has few advantages</p>
<p>* My wordpress is pristine Wordpress with just my theme files. If I need to move or change hosting providers, I can do it with just the Database Backup and can do it within minutes.<br />
* Reduces load on your Wordpress hosting provider thus staying within their bandwidth limit (mostly).<br />
* AWS (S3, Cloudfront) is pretty cheap and thanks to CloudFlare, the cost can be cut to half.</p>
<p>That's it, simple and straight, (i) go for good Wordpress specific hosting provider (ii) CloudFlare.</p>
