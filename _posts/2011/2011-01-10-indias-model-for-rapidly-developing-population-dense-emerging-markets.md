title: India's Model for Rapidly Developing Population Dense Emerging Markets
---
<p>India has been on the cutting edge of technology and emerging trends since the 1990s and they have created a customizable system for other population dense countries looking to rapidly develop to bring the bulk of their population into the new technological revolution. </p>
<p>Since India's rapid development started in the 1990s it has become the 11th largest economy in the world and has the 4th largest purchasing power parity.  It also has approximately 1/6th of the worlds 6 billion+ people, 80% of who are barely accounted for statistically.</p>

<p>This huge burgeoning and unrepresented market is being brought to the foreground by an incredibly daunting task undertaken by India to provide their population with a Unique ID. This system will use technology to connect their unconnected.</p>
<p>According to an article by international market research company Nielsen the system will improve over a billion lives. Nielsen quoted Nandan Nilekani, Chairman of the Unique Authority of India as saying that "over a third of India's 1.1 billion consumers had been largely overlooked in areas such as banking and social services."</p>
<p>The goal of this program is to provide banking and social services to the 80% of the Indian population without access to many of the resources now available in India, thanks to its incredible growth. Nilekani was also quoted as saying that "the poor remain a difficult to reach market. Their anonymity limits agencies from providing them services that are remotely available, and that could be accessed through a mobile phone. The absence of a universal, easy to verify identity system also prevents agencies from scaling towards national-level, more open systems where the poor can access services seamlessly, wherever they migrate."</p>
<p>This unique ID system will also open up huge markets for India's affordable technologies, advertising markets, and more. </p>
<p>This system implemented by India has created a model worth copying for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, South-East Asia and other areas with large populations without access to necessary technologies and social services that are vital to thrive in the modern world. </p>
<p>India has been the world's model for changing from third-world country to world leader; now they can begin to share their systems and technologies with the developing world through a system that can be replicated.</p>
