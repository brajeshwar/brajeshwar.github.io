<a href="http://www.nexercise.com/">Nexercise</a> is a free iPhone game that encourages people to exercise more frequently and consistently, by making the experience of exercising more fun and rewarding.

To play all you need to do is exercise for a minimum of 15 minutes with your smartphone on you. The app measures the motion of the device to prove that you've exercised. Each time you Nexercise you have a chance to win virtual medals, discounts and even free merchandise.

Nexercise's lottery style rewards system acts as an initial carrot for motivation and as a continual feedback loop to encourage habit formation.
