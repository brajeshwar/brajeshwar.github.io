<p>Another one of the many finer little details that makes the Mac OS X stand apart from everything else. I was tweaking my screensaver when I noticed that the places mentioned in my iPhoto Album are marked with the right icons.</p>
<p>India have an Indian flag while USA's got the US flag. An address is marked with a pin on the globe, California and Karnataka got their sign-boards, while the cities of Mountain View and San Francisco got skyscraper icons.</p>
