title: Mac OS X Lion knows you!
---

Another one of the many finer little details that makes the Mac OS X stand apart from everything else. I was tweaking my screensaver when I noticed that the places mentioned in my iPhoto Album are marked with the right icons.

India have an Indian flag while USA's got the US flag. An address is marked with a pin on the globe, California and Karnataka got their sign-boards, while the cities of Mountain View and San Francisco got skyscraper icons.
