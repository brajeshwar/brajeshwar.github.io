<p>One of the early topics in the Founder Institute curriculum is "Startup Research". Here is a video and <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/33104662/SVFI-June-15-Start-up-Research-Adeo-Ressi">slides</a> of a Startup Research lesson to the Silicon Valley program by Adeo Ressi, Founder of the Founder Institute.</p>
<p>The talk provides an overview of how the character of different markets affects the reality of operation, how good research is critical to helping a founder understand both the journey and the destination, and how founders cannot escape the realities of the market that they are in. It is a very informative lesson and provides many practical tips for performing diligent market research before diving into a market.

<h3>text-overflow</h3>
<p>You can now pretty much start using text-overflow CSS property as Firefox is implementing it soon. Other browsers pretty much <a href="http://www.caniuse.com/#search=text-overflow">support them</a> for quite sometime - IE9, Chrome, Opera, Safari.</p>
<p>Here's how to show an ellips to represent clipped text:</p>
<pre><code>.ellips {
    overflow: hidden;
    white-space: nowrap; /* pre works as well */
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://bricss.net/post/7389475148/text-overflow-almost-supported-everywhere">Here is why</a>, "If you want to give users a chance of reading the clipped text, you could set overflow to auto instead of hidden to make a scrollbar appear. When this happens, the spec says that browsers should let users scroll to show more content. This only seems to work in Opera and IE9."</p>
<h3>Simple is Beautiful</h3>
<p>Another amazing article from Andrew Chen on being simple is the better way - Simple products aren't only better designed, they're easier to market too. Highly optimized and simple products are dead simple to use - they have landing pages that communicate a compelling value, soft on-boarding flows, clear calls to action, and simple mechanics that drive a lot of value. The same things that make it a highly marketable product are the same things that make it well-designed, and a great thing for which every product should strive.</p>

<p>While we're on the topic of marketing, here is a marketing truth from Conversation Marketing - <a href="http://www.conversationmarketing.com/2011/07/marketing-truths-people-pleasure-prevention.htm">People buy pleasure, not prevention</a>. So, whatever you're selling, make it a provider of good. Not a preventer of bad.</p>
<p>* Don't sell burglar protection. Sell security.<br />
* Don't sell bike helmets. Sell really cool Transformer helmets that every kid's gonna want.<br />
* Sell a 'good', not a preventer of 'bad', and you'll beat your less savvy competitors.</p>
