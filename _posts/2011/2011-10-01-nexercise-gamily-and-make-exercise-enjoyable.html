<p>Nexercise's lottery style rewards system acts as an initial carrot for motivation and as a continual feedback loop to encourage habit formation.  Additionally, Nexercise bakes in behavioral psychology techniques like status, accountability and competition into its game mechanics.  The result is fitness experience that is more social, sticky, and engaging.</p>
