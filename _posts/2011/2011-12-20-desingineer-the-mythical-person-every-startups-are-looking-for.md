# Desingineer - the mythical person every startup is looking for

> "Desingineer" - mythical person startups are looking for who can do UI, UX and also excellent front-and back-end coding. -- Chris Dixon (@cdixon) [Dec 19, 2011](https://twitter.com/cdixon/statuses/148896542462455808)

Many founders have asked me, “Can you get me a designer who can code in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Ruby?” My answer is, “you‘re looking for a genius; you should try splitting it into (i) a designer who does HTML, CSS (ii) a programmer, and (iii) perhaps even a separate Javascript coder.”

## Why?

Someone good in both worlds of design and development is mythical or rare. They’re already doing something independently, are already kicking ass, and are not available.

I had the privilege of working with a few such geniuses, and they’re doing very well on their own. I’ve tried my hands on both worlds but never came close to being that good, leave alone being a genius.

If you find someone, who can seamlessly walk between these two worlds of designing and development, give them everything they need and have them on your side. They're some of the rarest breeds.

So, what do you say? How many “Desingineer” do you know?
