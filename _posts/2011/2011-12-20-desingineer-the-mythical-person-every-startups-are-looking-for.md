> "Desingineer" - mythical person startups are looking for who can do UI, UX and also excellent front-and back-end coding. -- Chris Dixon (@cdixon) [Dec 19, 2011](https://twitter.com/cdixon/statuses/148896542462455808)

Of course, many founders who have also asked me, keep saying, "we need a designer who can code in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Python/Ruby." My usual answer is, "you're looking for a genius, you should try splitting it into (i) a designer who does HTML, CSS (ii) a programmer and (iii) perhaps even a separate Javascript coder."

## Why?

As Chris mentioned, someone who is good (let's not even consider awesome) in both worlds of design and development is either mythical or very rare. They're doing something on their own, are already kicking ass, and are not available.

I had the privilege to have worked with a few such geniuses and they're doing very good on their own. I've tried my hands on both worlds but never came close to being that good, leave alone being a genius.

If you find someone, who is even close to, or comfortable striding in these two worlds of designing and development, give them everything they need and have them on your side. They're some of the rarest breeds.

So, what do you say? How many "Desingineer" do you know?
