A [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/cdixon/status/148896542462455808) led to [an article](/2011/desingineer-the-mythical-person-every-startups-are-looking-for/), which was fortunate to be on [Hackernews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3373702). The above two-minute video is a cut of how my site experienced the traffic during it's initial first hour on Hackernews.
