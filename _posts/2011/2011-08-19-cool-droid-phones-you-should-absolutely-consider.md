<p>Android phones have revolutionized our lives. From searching for a nearest hotel to stay while traveling, to meet emergencies like admitting into a nearest best hospital for medical care; Androids have touched every sphere of life. You have images, movies, music, games and applications and what not, everything on it! For many younger generations it has become a way of life. There are some strong addicts too. There are some teens that can stay away from their girlfriends and boyfriends but not from androids.
