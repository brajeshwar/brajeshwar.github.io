# LiveShare from Cooliris
There seem to be no lack of Photo sharing sites these days. <a href="http://www.liveshare.com/">LiveShare</a> is the newest offering from <a href="http://www.cooliris.com/">Cooliris</a>.  LiveShare is available for your phones (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id383848397?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="http://market.android.com/details?id=com.cooliris.app.liveshare">Android</a> or <a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=7daafbde-1f2f-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">Windows 7</a>) and also for the Web. LiveShare is targetted towards get-togethers, parties, sporting events, trips, and other experiences with friends and family, as multiple cameras share into the group photo streams you create.

Users  can create private streams to collaboratively share photos from friends' weddings, to keep in touch with family all across the world, and even to share crazy and <a href="http://nsfw.in/">NSFW</a> (not safe for work) moments from bachelor parties in Vegas, etc.

LiveShare is also a great way for celebrities and brands such as Paris Hilton, ESPN and Michael Buble (just to name a few) to connect with fans. <a href="http://www.parishilton.com/">Paris Hilton</a>, for example, currently has an exclusive stream where she posts photos from her daily life that fans can't see anywhere else besides her LiveShare.
