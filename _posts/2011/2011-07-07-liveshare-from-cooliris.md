<p>There seem to be no lack of Photo sharing sites these days. <a href="http://www.liveshare.com/">LiveShare</a> is the newest offering from <a href="http://www.cooliris.com/">Cooliris</a>.  LiveShare is available for your phones (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id383848397?mt=8">iPhone</a>, <a href="http://market.android.com/details?id=com.cooliris.app.liveshare">Android</a> or <a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=7daafbde-1f2f-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">Windows 7</a>) and also for the Web. LiveShare is targetted towards get-togethers, parties, sporting events, trips, and other experiences with friends and family, as multiple cameras share into the group photo streams you create.</p>

<p>Users  can create private streams to collaboratively share photos from friends' weddings, to keep in touch with family all across the world, and even to share crazy and <a href="http://nsfw.in/">NSFW</a> (not safe for work) moments from bachelor parties in Vegas, etc.</p>
<p>LiveShare is also a great way for celebrities and brands such as Paris Hilton, ESPN and Michael Buble (just to name a few) to connect with fans. <a href="http://www.parishilton.com/">Paris Hilton</a>, for example, currently has an exclusive stream where she posts photos from her daily life that fans can't see anywhere else besides her LiveShare.</p>
