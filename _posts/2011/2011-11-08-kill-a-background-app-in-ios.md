<p>Perhaps, I'm one of the last few to discover that I can manually terminate an app running in the background in iOS. This is helpful when an app is acting up or not responsive or just want to kill it while testing your app.</p>
<p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<p># Double Click/Tab the Home Button.<br />
# When Multitask bar rolls up at the bottom with all your apps you ever opened, tap and hold one of the app till it start to 'jiggle'.<br />
# Now, tap the (-) for the app you want to kill instantly.</p>
<p><em>Note: This just kills that app not its associated services like notifications, etc.</em></p>
