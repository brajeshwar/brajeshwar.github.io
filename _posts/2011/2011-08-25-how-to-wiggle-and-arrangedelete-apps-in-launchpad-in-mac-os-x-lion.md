<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> introduced <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X Lion</a> with a gradual shift towards iOS or an iOS-ish experience. Here is how you can wiggle, arrange, delete Apps on your Launchpad on Mac OS X Lion, pretty much like how you do on you iOS devices (<a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> or the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a>).

Here's how:

- Launch Launchpad or do the three finger swoop-in.
- Click and Hold on an App till they started to wiggle.
- Now, you can arrange, group them into folders or even delete Apps.
