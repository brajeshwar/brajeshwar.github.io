title: Why are iFans shocked with iPhone 4S Release -- it is standard Apple operating procedure
---

Millions of loyal iFans held their bated breath while waiting for the release of the much-anticipated iPhone 5, but unfortunately instead of breathing a sigh of relief their expelled air was used to form their favorite curse word as they gazed on the iPhone 4S. Son of a...

Apple surprised the world, and shocked the hell out of their users, by releasing the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone 4S</a>, instead of the more-anticipated iPhone 5 -- but this shouldn't have been a surprise really. The release of the iPhone 4S falls right into the typical release pattern from Apple, which also happens to coincide with the product life-cycle created by cellphone carrier contracts -- two years.


The half-step, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/#siri">Siri</a>-enabled iPhone 4S is part of a brilliant marketing plan from Apple to lure new users -- but it wasn't intended to be an upgrade for current iPhone 4 users.  It is really quite brilliant. And perfectly in step with their previous release pattern: 3G to 3GS, to 4 to 4S, then 5. With the release of half-step iPhones Apple is ensuring that they claim new users every year, instead of every two years with carrier upgrades. 

The iPhone 5 is coming, but not likely anytime soon. Apple experts are predicting the release in summer 2012. So, should you upgrade to the iPhone 4S now or wait for the iPhone 5? Depends, how much money have you go to waste? Just keep in mind though, Apple has a solid strategy of releasing a new iPhone (half, or full-step) every year. If you plan on upgrading with every new phone released you better workout an iPhone budget -- especially considering that the 64GB 4S's cost is $399 with a contract.

But, if you just can't wait for the 8MP camera that can take <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/#hdvideo">1080p HD video</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/#performance">dual core A5 chip</a>, or <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/#siri">Siri</a> -- then go ahead and waste your money on it, that's what money is for. Siri, the voice-recognition software that interacts with the phone and its apps in an uber-intelligent way, might be worth it. I mean, it can send texts, set reminders, pull up weather reports, and interact with your other daily-use apps.
