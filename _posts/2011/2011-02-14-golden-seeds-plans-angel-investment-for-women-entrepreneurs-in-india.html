<p><a href="http://www.goldenseeds.com/">Golden Seeds</a>, a U.S based angel investing group that promotes women entrepreneurs, is exploring opportunities in India. A delegation of 14 will be visiting Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai, meeting with the early stage investing community and entrepreneurs. As part of this, 10 entrepreneurs are being selected from a call for business plans to pitch for funding from Golden Seeds as well as investors based in India on March 5th, 2011 at a day-long event to be held at the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>

The group is now interested to understand how it can participate in the entrepreneurial and investing marketplace in India.</p>
