## Few of the not-so good things that I noticed

The interface is a bit clunky, confusing at first use. For instance, I could not find a way to browse all photos or categories until I did a Search and click from there. Another noticeable usability issue was that of 404 (Not Found) being re-directed back to their homepage. For a photo, video, media site, I'm really itching to have a much cleaner, sleeker, crispier design.
