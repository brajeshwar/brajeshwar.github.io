<p><a href="http://www.goldenseeds.com/">Golden Seeds</a>, a U.S based angel investing group that promotes women entrepreneurs, is exploring opportunities in India. A delegation of 14 will be visiting Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai, meeting with the early stage investing community and entrepreneurs. As part of this, 10 entrepreneurs are being selected from a call for business plans to pitch for funding from Golden Seeds as well as investors based in India on March 5th, 2011 at a day-long event to be held at the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Golden Seeds invests in high-growth scalable companies that have a large addressable market. The group has invested over $25 million in about 30 companies in the last 5 years. In 2010, Golden Seeds invested in 9 new companies and completed 11 follow-on investments for a record investing year. The group is now interested to understand how it can participate in the entrepreneurial and investing marketplace in India.</p>
