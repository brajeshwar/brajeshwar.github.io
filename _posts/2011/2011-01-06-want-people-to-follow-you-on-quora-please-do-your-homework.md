<p>With the recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/05/quora-surge/">growth explosion</a> of Quora, I'm pretty sure everyone is following and being followed by lots of other people. Lots of Quora users <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/quora">tweeted</a> about 'turning off email notifications' for new followers as there were lots of 'followings' happening around.</p>
<p>This would apply to many similar services and so also for Quora. If you follow other people and eventually want people to follow you, please do some homework and complete some basic steps before firing up that 'follow everyone I know' button.</p>
<p>* Complete your profile. Write a Description. (People need to remember who you are and why they should follow you.)<br />
* Upload your picture. An online avatar, be it your own photo or of your cat, is something that people recognize you by.<br />
* Answer at-least couple of questions. Or ask some which are relevant to you or your industry.</p>
<p>These are simple steps but it will help people remember who you're and follow you back to help a meaningful conversation on Quora. It is not easy if you just follow me and I see nothing on your profile (no picture, no questions, no answers). I'm pretty sure other users have the same sentiment.</p>
<h3>Quora</h3>
<p>Quora is a continually improving collection of questions and answers created, edited, and organized by everyone who uses it. The most important thing is to have each question page become the best possible resource for someone who wants to know about the question.</p>
