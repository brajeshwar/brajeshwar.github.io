<p>The amazing thing about technology is that the curiosity and spirit of a new system does not depend solely on the expense of the product. This fact is upheld repeatedly when open source technologies launch their impressive additions to existing technology, in the market. The latest to join this impressive line is <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/">Ubuntu's 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/"><img src="/static/2011/10/ubuntu-oneiric-ocelot.jpg" alt="Oneiric ocelot" /></a></p>
<p>Linux enthusiasts have always raved about Ubuntu's specifications - <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/13/ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-ocelot-now-available-to-download/">the 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot is a developed version of the Ubuntu 11.04</a>. Ubuntu has always been a marvel in open source technologies due to the operating system's extreme ease of access and user friendly interface. These are now accompanied with improved features to bring forth better user experience for Ubuntu fans. Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot is available in 38 different languages. Users can access the OS from the official Ubuntu site. If you are already a user of Ubuntu 11.04, you can just opt for an upgrade instead of a full download. However, if your system shows some adaptation problems just uninstall the 11.04 and fully install the 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot. This step should eliminate any major specification related troubles.</p>
<h3>Improvements that give an edge over 11.04 </h3>
<p># The biggest charge that 11.04 had against it was the mobile interface of Unity that played as the primary desktop interface for the operating system. While 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot has the unity shell installed within it, GNOME 3 has also been included in the package to serve as an alternative option for users.<br />
# The software has definitely added on improvements in usability and appeal. The new 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot has more speed and aids in fast search functions. The design and interface have been vastly enhanced and made more aesthetic.<br />
# The Ubuntu 11.10 version meant for servers has added on features that help to deploy and host in an easily manageable way. The <a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-ocelot-desktop-new-features.html">ARM technology architecture</a> aids in bringing Ubuntu to the latest horizons. You can test drive the choreographed smooth orchestration of the data-structure services by this latest OS.<br />
# The biggest edge that Linux line of products will continue to have over most of the competitors in the field is that they are free. The complexity of the system was always an issue but the latest versions of the services have all directed upon making this a non-issue. </p>
<p>The obvious deductions state that the multi-functional operating systems and the added lure of no cost service will definitely ensure that the lead of <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/the-perfect-desktop-ubuntu-11.10-oneiric-ocelot">the competition will soon exchange hands</a>. The statistics prove the theory largely when the latest figure of people using the 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot hit the 20 million mark.</p>
<p>Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot is being released in the usual three image series. They have the server versions, the desktop versions, and the alternate installation CD version for other machines. It is very simple to access any of these versions. Just go to <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/">releases.ubuntu.com/11.10</a> to access all the download mirror information as well as the specifications chart that will allow you to detect the image that best suits your purposes. </p>
<p>The reason of technology's existence is to improve your life. It is justified that technology should also keep at constantly improving itself to tackle the changed situations and demands of your life. Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot shows definite potential in this regard.</p>
