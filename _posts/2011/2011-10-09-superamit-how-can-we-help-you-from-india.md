<p>I looked around, clicked on every clickable link on your site but there seem to be no way to even see if I can help, unless I'm in the US. Any idea how can the people from South Asian region help out?</p>
<blockquote><p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://tumblr.amitgupta.com/day/2011/10/06">Amit Gupta</a> was diagnosed with Acute Leukemia. He needs a bone marrow transplant.
