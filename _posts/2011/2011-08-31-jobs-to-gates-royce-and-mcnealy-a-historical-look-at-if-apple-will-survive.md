<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Steve-Jobs-Resigns-as-CEO-of-Apple.html">Steve Jobs has left Apple</a>. I have expected to see stock prices crumble, Apple Geniuses to go rogue and iPhones to fall out of the sky; but despite the near-panic of nearly every Internet news station -- its really not that big a deal, we will be fine (unless you own large amounts of Apple stock, in which case it is time to panic).</p>
<p>If history has taught us anything, and it hasn't, its that changes in leadership are rarely as dramatic as we fear -- just look at Obama.</p>
<p>Looking at this issue historically may give the issue more perspective, as many large tech innovators have changed leadership in the past: Microsoft with Bill Gates, Intel and Robert Noyce, Sun and Scott McNealy.</p>

<h3>Microsoft and Billy Gates</h3>
<p>The best historical comparison we can use for enigmatic Steve Jobs, is enigmatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill Gates</a>. In terms of company size, they are both high-value firms with Apple's current valuation at $349 billion and when Billy left Steve Balmer in charge of Microsoft it was valued at $600 billion. Microsoft is currently valued at just $201 billion. And I think Gate's valuation dropped the same amount (after he gave a huge chunk of his fortune to the Gates Foundation).</p>
<p>The succession of Jobs is similar to the story of Gates, as he will stay on the board of directors, however; it is unlikely that Jobs will hold Tim Cook's hand for a decade like Gates did for Balmer. </p>
<p>Perhaps we do have reason to worry with the massive devaluation of the other high-profile regime change. Or perhaps this will simply be Microsoft's year to bounce back and reclaim its throne as Supreme-Ruler-of-the-Tech-Monpoly.  </p>
<p>On a personal note maybe we will see the creation of the Jobs Foundation -- providing starving children everywhere with iPads.</p>

<h3>Intel and Robbie Noyce</h3>
<p>Unlike Microsoft, Intel's tale of change is more positive. When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Noyce">Robert Noyce</a> passed the reigns to engineering-superstar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore">Gordon Moore</a>, the company's 43-year success story continued. When Moore gave way to cut-throat businessman Andy Grove, they thrived. The succession to Craig Barratt and Paul Otellini only continued the strong leadership patterns. Intel also has a long-standing tradition of moving their CEOs to board leader positions so perhaps Apple's story will mimic Intel's.</p>
<p>Take into consideration of course that none of them were the strong face-of-the-company or sexy-poster-child and cancer-survivor like Steve. Nonetheless Intel did fine. It is currently valued at $115 billion.</p>

<h3>Sun and Scott McNealy</h3>
<p>Spoiler: this one is worse than the Microsoft example. In 2006 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy">Scott McNealy</a> gave up his 22-year carer steering Sun Microsystems to success when he passed the helm to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_I._Schwartz">Jonathan Schwartz</a>. Schwartz then ran the ship aground. Schwartz never had much of a chance with his two years of executive management experience, despite his decade-long commitment to the company. Schwartz lasted only three years as leader before the financial crisis of 2008 dry-docked the ship forever, and they were taken over by Oracle. </p>
<p><em>Think for Yourself</em></p>
<p>Despite the rampant rumors about the future of Apple, think for yourself. Who knows whether Apple will go the route of Intel, Sun or Microsoft -- but does it really matter (other than for large-scale Apple stockholders)? </p>
<p>But -- just in case you are a true Mac-head -- stock up on your Apple gear now.</p>
