<p>Sending invoices to a client or a customer every time they place an order on your online store can be quite a daunting task. The same activity can consume the productive time of your business. But, guess what? Here comes the good news. A Company well-known for its online software for invoicing and billing service - <a href="http://www.invoicera.com/">Invoicera</a> has launched its services on online invoicing in real time to <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/">Magento</a>, an Open source based ecommerce webcart for online businesses. Henceforth, it will not be a tedious process anymore of sending manual invoices every time you receive an order in your online store.</p>

<p>Further, Magento helps you control every aspect of your online store and leaves you with a good online buying experience. This merger will allow Magento store customers or users to automatically create and send professional invoices in real time within the Invoicera panel whenever an order is placed on its web store. With this extension, you can save your precious time by automatically importing orders to your Invoicera account and can easily cut down the hours spent on time-expense tracking into a few minutes or so.
