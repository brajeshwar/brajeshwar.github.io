If you want to know more before downloading the book, check the details at <a href="http://www.photoshopsupport.com/photoshop-blog/08/05/free-photoshop-book-anthology-101.html">Photoshop Support</a>. Here are some excerpts;</p>
<p><strong>Who Should Read this Book?</strong></p>
<p>This book is ideal for all web designers working with Photoshop: if you're new to the application, there's enough beginner material here to give you a great grounding in the basics, but if you've got a bit more experience up your sleeve, there's coverage of a multitude of advanced tutorials for you to get your designs looking beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>What Version of Photoshop do I Need?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the techniques in the book will work regardless of the version of Adobe Photoshop that you're using. However, the book is intended for web designers using Photoshop CS2, and there are some solutions that make use of the newer features in this version. Some of the shortcuts differ between versions of Photoshop, so keep this in mind if you're working with an older version.</p>
