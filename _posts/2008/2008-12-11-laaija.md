# Laaija

Shanta was expected to deliver our baby somewhere around the last week of December 2008. However, her water broke on the 11th Dec, 2008 and my best means to reach her (she was in our home town then) was the next day. So, I missed the whole drama when Shanta gave birth to [Laaija](http://laaija.com/) at 2:00 pm on Dec 11, 2008.

Ever since Shanta conceived, I had told her that I wanted a girl though I was prepared for a boy nonetheless. I went ahead picking a bunch of names for a girl. Laaija is a [Manipuri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipuri) word which translates to _Water_, more aptly the clear water offered to the deities during religious ceremonies. Even though I'm not religious, I liked the name. I was also concerned that it should not be a typical Indian name like mine (Brajeshwar) which makes it difficult for non-Indians.

In today's connected internet world, I wanted a more easier name which can crossover effortlessly across countries, east-west-north-south.
