<p><img src="/static/2008/04/twhirl.gif" alt="Twhirl" style="border: 0 none;" />The acquisition of Twhirl, for an undisclosed amount, by <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a> is an interesting news from many angle, the most interesting being Twhirl an AIR application which can run on both Windows and Mac, and of course on Linux.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">Twhirl</a> is a popular desktop Twitter client, based on the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/air/">Adobe AIR platform</a>, developed by Marco Kaiser. Besides being able to acess Twitter service directly from the Desktop, Twhirl also cross post to other services like <a href="http://www.pownce.com/">Pownce</a> and <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>.</p>
<p>Twhirl is one of the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_twitter_clients_definitive_list.php">best Desktop Twitter clients</a> available, amongst others like <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a> and Instant Messenger Clients. Seesmic plans to enhance the application further and eventually make it the official Seesmic Desktop Client.</p>
<p>I hope this news made a sudden burst of interest among Windows, Mac and Linux AIR Developers.</p>
