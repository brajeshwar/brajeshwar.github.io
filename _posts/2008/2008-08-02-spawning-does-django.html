  of code.

<p>Our team had a discussion yesterday why Spawning might be a good solution for our Python-Django specific Web server. The discussion is still hot on the table and have not come to a conclusion; nonetheless, Spawning does look really promising if we are to extract every ounce of power from a server and utilize its full power. We were questioning if using Apache is like using a "sledgehammer to swat flies".</p>
<p><!--more--><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Spawning/">Spawning</a> is a <a href="http://www.wsgi.org/">WSGI</a> server, written using eventlet, which supports multiple processes, multiple threads, non-blocking HTTP io, and automatic graceful upgrading of code. Eventlet is a networking library written using coroutines instead of normal subroutes, which makes writing networked non-blocking IO applications much much simpler.</p>
<p>Spawning will scale to a large number of keep-alive connections easily. However, it also delegates requests using other forms of multiprocessing and is configurable to be useful in a wide variety of situations. It supports multiple Python processes as well as a threadpool.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://ulaluma.com/pyx/">Donovan Preston</a>, the man behind Spawning, there are lots of advantages of using a server like Spawning -- one of the most obvious being its ability to do "complete graceful code reloading". With the latest release, Spawning can easily run <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> apps too.
