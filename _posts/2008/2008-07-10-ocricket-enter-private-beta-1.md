title: oCricket enter Private Beta 1
---

I've been thinking of doing something about the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">Cricket</a> but was always half-hearted about it. However, it began to take shape during the summer of 2007. oCricket was started with Java during late 2007. I found it too bulky for what I need and by early 2008, it was moved it to PHP. It wasn't bad but somehow I was not satisfied with PHP either. The third and current iteration is done with Python, and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> as the framework.

oCricket is now in closed Private Beta?

Well, it is the must-do these days, so we're in a private beta where the testers have agreed more or less to report back issues and go along with the development in a progressive manner.
