I've been thinking of doing something about the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">Cricket</a> but was always half-hearted about it. However, it began to take shape during the summer of 2007. oCricket was started with Java during late 2007. I found it too bulky for what I need and by early 2008, it was moved it to PHP. It wasn't bad but somehow I was not satisfied with PHP either. The third and current iteration is done with Python, and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> as the framework.</p>
<p><strong>oCricket is now in closed Private Beta?</strong></p>
<p>Well, it is the must-do these days, so we're in a private beta where the testers have agreed more or less to report back issues and go along with the development in a progressive manner.</p>
<p><strong>Any Invites?</strong></p>
<p>I'll give our bulk invites in future but for now, it will have to be hand-picked and very individual. You can request for an invite by submitting a valid email through the site -- <a href="http://ocricket.com/">oCricket</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Btw, here's a gift for you.</strong></p>
<p>I've a <strong>100% discount</strong> coupon for Freeverse's <a href="http://freeverse.com/lineform/">LineForm</a> which cost $79.95. I'll pick one lucky winner from those who ask for an invite on <a href="http://ocricket.com/">oCricket</a> during this month of July. S/he will get that Discount code and can get the full license of LineForm from their online store..</p>
