<blockquote><p>So far this has only taken a day of development, and the main app is only 150 lines of code. Flex 3 makes this kind of app so darn simple to put together.</p></blockquote>
<p>RegExr is available online and is free. Grant have promised to release a Free Desktop version built with AIR in a day or two. So, the desktop version can be used on Mac, Windows and Linux (in the near future). The online version requires Flash Player 9.</p>
