<p class="caption"><em>Open Sourced Notebook</em>How much does it cost you?</p>
</div>
<p>If you're looking forward to start up a small business enterprise, investment happens to be a key concern. How much, how less and where exactly; these are the preliminary encounters.</p>
<p>Open source software has a lot of options for the business world, alongside the home user bandwagon.  Apart from the other generic features, Open Source Software at times have a greater degree of customization as compared to their proprietary counterparts. This very fact is pretty evident with the fact that several large companies like -- Google, Amazon, Yahoo, <em>et al</em> run their servers on Linux, again an Open Source OS.</p>
<p>The idea behind this article is not to force start you to follow the Open Source path, but to make you look at the same as an alternative before you shell out a few hundred or thousand dollars for a close<br />
source and non-free product which does pretty much the same as it's Open Source and free alternative.</p>
<p>Before we move on, I would like to clear out that free software and Open Source Software are two different entities, though they often come as a bundle!</p>
<p>Today, we shall have a look at a few Open Source Software which may just help you kick start your business.</p>
<p><strong>Operating System</strong></p>
<p><img style="float: none; border: 0 none;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2008/07/fedora.png" alt="Fedora" /></p>
<p>The first need shall be to have a robust, secure and customizable operating system, both for the server(s) and the workstation(s). There are a lot of options available when it comes to Linux. Have a look at them at one of our previous posts - <a href="http://brajeshwar.wpengine.com/2008/choice-of-linux-distros/">Which Linux distro is right for you?</a></p>
<p>I would recommend <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> for free, or <a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a>, if you can pay a bit for a great enterprise support. They have a cutting edge robustness and come with a lot of applications like OpenOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird, etc. as pre-loaded, catering your major necessities.</p>
