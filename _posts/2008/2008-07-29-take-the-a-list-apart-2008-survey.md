I took it! And so should you. The Survey for People Who Make Websites.</p>
<p>This year's survey corrects many of last year's mistakes, with more detailed and numerous questions for freelance contractors and owners of (or partners in) small web businesses. There are also better international categories, and many other improvements recommended by those who took the survey last year.</p>
<p>Industry experts have taken the survey;</p>

<p>Please take the survey and encourage your friends and colleagues who make websites to do likewise.</p>
