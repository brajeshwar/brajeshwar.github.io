PicLens is a free download that transforms your browser into a full-screen 3D experience for online images and videos. With their recent update, they've included metadata such as image title labels of Flickr photo captions, while you surf through the images.

They've also integrated a new UI, which further streamlines navigation with a more obvious Jump to Page button and an improved full-screen mode. You can get a true full-screen zoom for both images and video alike.

PicLens is available for Firefox 2.0 and above, Internet Explorer on Windows Vista, XP, and Mac OSX. Download your free copy of <a href="http://www.piclens.com/">PicLens</a>.
