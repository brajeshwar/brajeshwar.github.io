<p><img src="/static/2008/04/dare.png" alt="DARE" style="border: 0 none;" />Amongst all the Adobe Media Player and Adobe TV articles that swamped my RSS Feed Reader today, there was a lone but very interesting article from Ted Patrick - <a href="http://www.onflex.org/DARE/">DARE</a>.</p>
<p>DARE will simplify AIR Application development for XHTML/JS/CSS Developers. They can easily develop AIR Apps pretty much like developing a HTML App -- no compilation -- just develop, "refresh" and you got your AIR App.<br />
<br />
<strong>Why DARE?</strong></p>
<p>Ted's argument is simple, crisp and clear;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are tons of HTML/JS/AJAX developers that never use the command line. DARE lowers the barrier to development with Adobe AIR by making development identical to writing HTML/JS/AJAX applications. Simply edit the file system and press refresh in the browser. It is that easy.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What is DARE?</strong></p>
<p>DARE is a local http server that makes it easy to create, test, and package AIR applications. It allows you to develop and test using your HTML/JS tools of choice and just a web browser. You can even use the "Refresh" button to test and package your application.</p>
<p>Download <a href="http://www.onflex.org/DARE/">DARE</a> (Mac).<br />
You'll need <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/air/">Adobe AIR</a> SDK.</p>
<p>You may keep a tap on <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/">Ted's blog</a> for future upgrades and the Windows Version.</p>
