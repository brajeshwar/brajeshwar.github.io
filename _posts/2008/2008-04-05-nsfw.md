# Making NSFW Safer

I had the idea of NSFW for quite a while after seeing a service and after being embarrassed in front of my team when a friend send me a link via TinyURL, "Hey, look at this. This is really funny!" Well, the link turn out to be some animating GIF which was a little way beyond funny and bordering on the lines of being a-bit-of-porn!

Currently, NSFW allows you to send a shortened URL which are Not-Safe-For-Work with a warning that the content/link outgoing onwards is `NOT-SAFE-FOR-WORK`. That's it. Either you go ahead or not is up-to you.

Try out [NSFW.in](http://nsfw.in/) and see how you can use it?
