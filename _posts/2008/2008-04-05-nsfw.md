excerpt: NSFW allows you to send a shortened and safer URL which are Not-Safe-For-Work
  with a warning that the content/link outgoing onwards is NOT-SAFE-FOR-WORK. That's
  it -- plain and simple.

<figcaption>NSFW make a safer shorter URL of your NSFW links.</figcaption>

<p>I had the idea of NSFW for quite a while after seeing a service and after being embarrassed in front of my team when a friend send me a link via TinyURL, "Hey, look at this. This is really funny!" Well, the link turn out to be some animating GIF which was a little way beyond funny and bordering on the lines of being a-bit-of-porn!</p>
<p>Currently, NSFW allows you to send a shortened URL which are Not-Safe-For-Work with a warning that the content/link outgoing onwards is <span class="reqd">NOT-SAFE-FOR-WORK</span>. That's it. Either you go ahead or not is up-to you.</p>
<p>Try out <a href="http://nsfw.in/">NSFW.in</a> and see how you can use it?</p>
