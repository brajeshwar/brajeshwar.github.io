# Open Source RIA books site - toString

Mike Chambers of Adobe have announced a new site that he've been working on called <a href="http://www.tostring.org/">tostring.org</a>, which in addition to containing the entire <a href="http://www.tostring.org/books/adobe-air-for-javascript-developers-pocketguide/">Adobe AIR for JavaScript Developers Pocketguide</a> online, also provides an infrastructure for the community to contribute to the books, both through hosting translated versions of the books, as well as allowing comments on individual chapters.

If you're into Adobe AIR, RIAs or the Flash Platform, the site tries to make it easier to reference / search the book content online. If you find an issue, or something isn't clear, Mike encourages its visitors/users to leave a comment on the chapter to clarify or get clarification.

All content on the site is released under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons licenses</a>, which in essence means that this is the community's site, and the books are the community's books.
