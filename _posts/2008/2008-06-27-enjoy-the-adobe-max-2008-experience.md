<p>Couple of days back, Adobe launched the official MAX NA Experience website. Take a look at the interactive landscapes provided by some of the leaded digital design agencies -- <a href="http://2advanced.com/">2Advanced</a>, <a href="http://www.bigspaceship.com/">Big Spaceship</a> and <a href="http://blitzagency.com/">Blitz</a>. It is a great site, provides just the right balance of information and experience and captures the exploratory tone of the <a href="http://max.adobe.com/">Adobe MAX event</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How to see the MAX NA Interactive Experience?</strong></p>
<p>To view the interactive experience on Adobe MAX 2008/2008 and click anywhere outside the informational window. Each visit is randomized to start at a different environment. Use your mouse to scroll left, right, up, and down in order to traverse all three landscapes.</p>
<p>In case of the 2Advanced jungle scene, there are certain actions that you must trigger in order to progress the story (Drag & drop, clicking, etc). See how far you can get by interacting with the environment and the clues it gives you.</p>
