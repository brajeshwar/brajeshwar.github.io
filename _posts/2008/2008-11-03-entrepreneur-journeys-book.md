title: Entrepreneur Journeys by Sramana Mitra
---

Using her own intimate knowledge of the entrepreneurial world, in this book renowned strategist and Forbes columnist Sramana Mitra captures the stories of entrepreneurs that have come before to help those who are looking to learn. Offering readers an inside view of how to navigate an entrepreneurial path, Mitra synthesizes candid conversations with her own incisive analysis, to create a unique set of case studies.

<a href="http://www.sramanamitra.com/">Sramana Mitra</a> is a technology entrepreneur and strategy consultant in Silicon Valley. She has a master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT.

In her recently released book -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439206872/">Entrepreneur Journeys</a> -- Sramana Mitra tells a narrative yet academic in its depth of insight about technology startup success, and the knowledge required to achieve it, which is out there to be leveraged by anyone who is willing to listen.

Sramana, in her book, highlights the most innovative entrepreneurs of our time -- Sridhar Vembu of AdventNet, Steve Hafner of Kayak, Gautam Godhwani of SimplyHired, Russ Fradin of Adify, Philippe Courtot of Qualys, Steve Singh of Concur, Marcos Galperin of MercadoLibre, Edward Fields of HotChalks, Hans Peter Michelet of Energy Recovery Incorporated, Carol Realini of Obopay and Harish Hande of SELCO.

Sramana analyzes, distills and discusses entrepreneur-to-entrepreneur such key issues as;

- Bootstrapping
- Taking on giants
- Disrupting business models
- Addressing unmet market needs
- Tackling planet scale problems

The Volume 1 of the series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439206872/">Entrepreneur Journeys</a> captures wisdom and advice for every technology entrepreneur and anyone interested in building a new business.

The book is unlike the typical business books which talks on and on about what to do, what not to do; instead it takes you through a narrative in a series of Interviews with some of the most successful entrepreneurs. This is an inspiring book and every budding entrepreneur should give it a read. I'm expecting that more Volumes will be printed soon and I would love to read more of the new-age internet-entrepreneur success stories.
