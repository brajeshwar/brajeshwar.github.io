<p>Friday is already here initiating the weekend, let's talk a bit about Entertainment (perhaps Movies). Sun UK have a sneak preview  bringing us good entertaining news -- Quantum of Solace will <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/film/movie_reviews/article1730883.ece">kick the living daylights</a> out of any rival action-hero franchises.</p>
<blockquote><p>Daniel Craig's second outing as the world's most famous secret agent is something you won't forget in a hurry.</p></blockquote>
<p>A refreshed Bond was introduced in 2006 as a gritty killing machine, a trigger happy agent, alcoholic-noob, man who falls in love. Daniel Craig as James Bond in Casino Royale was an ultimate hit with the fans.</p>
<p>Sun reports that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830515/">Quantum of Solace</a> kicks off with Bond in the car chase of his life as his Aston Martin DB9 is pursued through the narrow cliff-top lanes of the Italian Lakes followed by a Bourne Ultimatum-style rooftop chase, with the famous Palio Horse Race as a stunning backdrop. The stunts, glamorously dangerous for good reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Chase</strong></p>
<p>A driver had head injuries after crashing into a wall filming the cliff-top chase. Another had a narrow escape after skidding off a cliff into a lake. And Craig needed eight stitches in his face after a fight scene and he had the top of a finger sliced off.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's a miracle anyone survived filming long enough for Bond to kill them in the movie. Quantum of Solace is the first 007 sequel, it picks up directly from where Casino Royale left off. Bond is out to get revenge for the death of his lover Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) at any cost. But his path of destruction leads him to the discovery of a new threat to the world, crime syndicate Quantum.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="/static/2008/09/quantum-of-solace-bond-girls.jpg" alt="Bond Girls: Camille (Olga Kurylenko) and Mi6 agent Fields (Gemma Arterton)" class="alignright" /></p>
<p>The story builds up as Quantum's mastermind billionaire-environmentalist Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) uses a campaign to save swathes of rainforest as a cover for his evil plan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, M (Judi Dench) is worried, "Bond, if you could avoid killing every lead there is, that would be appreciated." To which, he dryly replies, "I will do my best" then heads off in designer suits to slay some more. Things get so bad that M revokes his licence to kill.</p>
<p>Here the notches on his gun far outnumber the notches on his bedpost. Nonetheless, there are two sexy Bond girls -- Camille (Olga Kurylenko) and Mi6 agent Fields (Gemma Arterton). But the only flash of flesh in the 105-minute movie (the shortest Bond Movie ever) is a very quick nookie scene with Fields.</p>
<blockquote><p>The smartass quips and camp gadget-king Q have also been axed. And for the first time the immortal line "The name's Bond, James Bond" is not used.</p></blockquote>
<p>In his pursuit of the bad guys, Bond goes from the UK to Italy to Bolivia to Austria, back to Italy, across to Haiti and finally to Russia. On the way, he writes off a fleet of cars, blows up a helicopter and military jetfighter, destroys a cargo plane and several boats.</p>
<p>Though not that ground-breaking as Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace will kick the living daylights out of any rival action-hero franchises.</p>
<p>The lucky residents of UK will be able to enjoy <strong>Quantum Of Solace</strong> on October 31, 2008, India will see it on November 7 while the US will have to wait till 14 November 2008.</p>
