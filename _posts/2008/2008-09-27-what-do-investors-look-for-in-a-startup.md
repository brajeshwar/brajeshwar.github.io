excerpt: It's obvious. It's a tautology. Everybody says it. You have to be working
  with some of the best people in the industry you're in. You've to have a great team.

<p>A great video Interview with Venture Hacker Naval Ravikant answering the age-old question:</p>
<p><strong>What do you look for in a startup?</strong></p>
<p>Investors look for two things that are paramount above all:</p>
<p># <strong>Great team:</strong> It's obvious. It's a tautology. Everybody says it. You have to be working with some of the best people in the industry you're in.<br />
# <strong>Huge market:</strong> Niche markets just don't work because the first idea never works. You always have to change the idea, so you need room to maneuver in a big market.</p>
<p>There are three more factors that investors look at:</p>
<p># Difficult technology that is compounding over time.<br />
# A proprietary distribution channel. A clever viral marketing, or partnership, or whatever strategy that gives them a leg up over competitors.<br />
# A direct monetization model. Something more than throwing up 10 cent banner ad CPMs.</p>
