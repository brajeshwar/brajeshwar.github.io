<p>So you've been playing around with your tux box for quite some time now. Experimenting with tar balls, the terminal, packages, distros, etc. may now be a part for your daily routine. If you remember, we talked about the existing <a href="/2008/career-in-linux-1/">career opportunities with Linux</a> in a <a href="/2008/career-in-linux-2/">two-post</a> article, few days back. A lot of youngsters admired that nibble of information. Keeping them in mind, I decided to come up with something that would emphasize more on learning the concepts rather than just trying things out randomly. (I know it's fun though!)</p>
<p>At this stage, or may be sometime in the near future if you plan to get your Linux knowledge a formal nurturing, an online course may be something you would be interested in! These courses would be beneficial for people who have time and interest to master the <a href="/2008/the-art-of-linux/">art of Linux</a> step by step. You may try them out and come up with a feedback as comments to this post.</p>
