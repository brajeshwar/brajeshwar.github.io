<p><strong>8th NOV, 2008: Startup Saturday</strong></p>
<p>I've heard the Bangalore Startup Saturday is rather a big event and have the most participants than other cities. I've been participating in the <a href="http://mumbai.startupsaturday.in/">Mumbai</a> Chapter since its inception by <a href="http://twitter.com/adityamishra">Aditya Mishra</a> and his awesome team. I've been an active spectator in earlier events but starting with the upcoming Startup Saturday (<em>Mumbai -- 8th Nov, 2008</em>), I'll be participating a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>The Presentation</strong></p>
<p>I've a presentation for the 8th Nov, 2008 Startup Saturday -- <strong>Bootstrapping a Startup! Have you done your homework?</strong> -- <a href="http://mumbai.startupsaturday.in/">Register and Join us</a>.</p>
<p>My presentation will likely talk about -- idea validation, forming the star team, finances, getting involved, what are you giving up and what do you plan to accomplish, how Venture Capitalists might view your startup, silicon valley startup vs the Indian Startup, acquisition friendly startup, thinking big but being frugal, commitments and sacrifices -- condensed into a short presentation with quite a bit of discussion/interaction.</p>
<p>I won't be talking about funding or raising capital at this time as I'm yet to conquer that task. The presentation will be loosely based on our Startup <a href="http://ocricket.com/">oCricket</a> and how we're working to give users an easy to use socio-networked website -- re-freshed, re-newed, re-engineered and re-everythinged Cricket.</p>
