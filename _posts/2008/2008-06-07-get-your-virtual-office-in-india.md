<p>Today morning, something caught my fancy with the Hindustan Times print, something about setting up a cheap virtual office for startups who need a physical address, phones number and assistants. I googled around to find one such service -- the <a href="http://www.servcorp.net/imperialservcorp/">Imperial Servcorp</a>.</p>
<p>Imperial Servcorp is a joint venture between real estate conglomerate K. Raheja Corp and Australian serviced office provider Servcorp. They've setup virtual office formats for Multinationals and Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across India. Their first Indian serviced office complex at Mumbai's Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) was inaugurated in February this year. I'm not sure but I suspect there are similar services in Hyderabad and Bangalore too.<br />
<br />
The virtual office, an innovative add-on to the serviced office format, is typically used by upcoming entrepreneurs. It provides them with an address in a business centre located in a prestigious location and meeting room space whenever necessary. So, one can operate from home without hiring staff or committing to a lease and yet have all call answered at an official telephone number and address.</p>
<p>The serviced office are spaces equipped with corporate infrastructure and support services and given out to companies on a pay-per-use basis. So, not just Indian companies but other Multinational Startups and companies can setup their presence in India quickly and in a very economical way. Virtual offices can serve as a stopgap arrangement until the companies establish themselves. Such services give you a buffer time to concentrate on expanding your business without having to worry about infrastructure or hiring support staff.</p>
<p>All this for an economical rate of just about Rs. 6,000 per month (roughly equivalent to $140 /mo). Check it out if you're in India or want to make an Indian presence without the overheard startup cost.</p>
