<p>The Fall 2008 quarter will mark the beginning of a new class: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/">CS193P iPhone Application Programming</a> from Stanford. The new class is focused on Apple's iPhone application development using Cocoa Touch.</p>
<p>You will need to have an Intel-based Macintosh in order to take this class. You will need to install the iPhone SDK too. However, there is no need to have an iPhone as the vast majority of the work can be done using the iPhone simulator (included in the iPhone SDK).</p>
<p>The class is being offered via <a href="http://scpd.stanford.edu/">Stanford Center for Professional Development</a>.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you are comfortable with programming in C, especially with regard to using pointers and general C memory management (malloc/free). Familiarity with object oriented designs and principles are definitely helpful but tend to pose less of a stumbling block than wrangling with pointers in C.</p>
