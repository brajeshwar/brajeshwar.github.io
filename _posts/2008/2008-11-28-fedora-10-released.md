# Fedora 10 Released

Let's talk history! <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> was created in late 2003 as a Linux based Operating System which gives the users an admittance from anywhere in the world to the most up-to-date free and open source software with user friendliness being the key. It also aspires to the creation of a community for everyone where developers across the globe can contribute with their knowledge and make the OS a superior coded platform. Fedora is sponsored by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux">Red Hat</a> and is built over the Linux kernel which is again supported by the Fedora project.

There was a <a href="http://blog.internetnews.com/skerner/2008/08/red-hat-fedora-servers-comprom.html">security breach</a> during the development stages of the project and this was the main reason of Cambridge, the code name for Fedora 10, coming into the gossip way before its launch. But the security breach was well handled by the developers and the result was the successful launch of Fedora 10. The new version is a modification over its earlier version with <em>improved open source security</em>, <em>appliance building technologies</em> and <em>virtualization</em>. The impediment in the release was due to the security breach at the Red Hat Fedora infrastructure but it still has the potential to become the most widely used Linux distribution installation software. 

A few tools that have been worked on and can help it stand ahead of the previous release;

* FreeIPA
* SELinux
* D-Bus
* NetworkManager
* PackageKit
* PulseAudio
* PolicyKit 

Paul Frields, <em>Fedora's project leader</em> said, 

If you look at our original schedule we were supposed to release around Oct. 28 and here we are, four weeks later than what we expected. During that time, our infrastructure team nuked our infrastructure and rebuilt the entire thing.

Though the reason for the failure in the security breach at Fedora project has still been kept under the cover, the company claims to make its full report available to everyone in a short time. Some significant improvements that have been incorporated in the new version are:

- The expansion plans of appliance options with the inclusion of the new Appliance Tools Technology which enables the proper building up of Fedora based appliances. The software developers use appliance tools such as AOS (Appliance Operating System) and ACT (Appliance Creation Tool). The creation of virtual software appliance, bare metal hardware appliance and Live CD based appliance would be a possibility with the usage of the above mentioned tool.
- A conscious branding endeavor has also been attempted in sync with the "Intel-inside" logo. The Fedora Remix logo can also be used for clear identification of Fedora's appliance tools.
- For the benefit of the users to view any technical defect in the system configuration, a new security audit tool viz. secTool has been launched. The tool also has the capability to perform own security tests as and when required by the user.
- VirtRemote Install is a tool which will enhance the virtualization capabilities and the administration of virtual machines on real hosts would become unproblematic.

Fedora has always kept Linux users happy with the assorted tools and applications. A yet another power-packed release, though with hint of "<em>controversy</em>"!
