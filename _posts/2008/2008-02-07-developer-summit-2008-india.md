# Developer Summit 2008, India

The Indian <a href="http://www.developersummit.com/">Developer Summit 2008</a> Features Co-located Conferences on Bleeding-edge .NET, Rich Web, Daring Java. The Call for Proposals are now Open and Nominations are invited for the Awards.

Under the hood of robust enterprise IT systems, infrastructure, software, products and applications, is the wisdom, passion, grit and experience of people who have contributed in multiple ways to make the end product successful. This collective ecosystem of "Developers" -- decision makers, analysts, architects, engineers, project managers, designers, and programmers -- is what makes the world of software tick.

The 2008 edition of the annual <a href="http://www.developersummit.com/">Great Indian Developer Summit</a>, centered around the theme of "Recipes for Enterprise Productivity", features a blockbuster convergence of three on-the-radar co-located conferences that no entity in the "Developer ecosystem" can ignore in their quest for success at work and in their careers -- Bleeding-edge .NET, Rich Web and Daring Java.
