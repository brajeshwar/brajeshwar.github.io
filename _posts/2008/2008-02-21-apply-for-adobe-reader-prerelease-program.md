title: Apply for Adobe Reader PreRelease
---

Adobe is currently accepting applications for their upcoming Adobe Reader PreRelease Program. Well, if you're not familiar with Adobe's PreRelease program, think of it like the typical Beta Program but a little more of a pre-cursor to a beta.

<a href="http://prerelease.adobe.com/">Adobe Prerelease</a> Programs are your chance to experience, evaluate and influence upcoming products & technologies from Adobe within a smaller, more focused user environment. Prerelease Programs facilitate a symbiotic development process allowing Adobe to share products in the development stage to gather early feedback. In the process you get a chance to shape the upcoming products and adapt to the new products faster.
