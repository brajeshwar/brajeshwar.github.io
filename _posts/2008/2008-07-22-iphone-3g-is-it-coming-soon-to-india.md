</div>

<p>Macworld Associate Editor Dan Moren has the <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/134594/2008/07/liveupdate.html">play-by-play of Apple's Q3 2008 financial results</a>. Apple COO Tim Cook and CFO Peter Oppenheimer were discussing Apple's results for the fiscal third quarter.</p>
<p>Questions from analysts about the tight supplies of iPhone 3Gs prompted Cook to mention Apple's expansion plans. Cook pointed out that the shortages are a result of "overwhelming demand" and that Apple was confident enough in its ability to boost production that <strong>it would expand the iPhone's market by 20 countries on August 22</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, that last part was the interesting part for the '<a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/countries/">other countries</a>' which includes India in the Coming Soon list of Countries.</p>
<p>ALRIGHT, so is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> expected to be <em>released early</em> in India? On the <strong>22nd of August</strong>, 2008?</p>
<p>Before you smile over that rumor/expectation, it may be noted that Cook didn't say which countries would be added to the iPhone's reach come August 22. Apple's iPhone page lists <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/countries/">50 countries</a> under a Coming Soon header that includes nations in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and Europe.</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple introduced the iPhone 3G on July 11 in 21 countries; France became the 22nd country to sell the revamped smart phone on July 17. Apple has reported strong demand for the device, tallying 1 million units sold in its first weekend of release.</p></blockquote>
