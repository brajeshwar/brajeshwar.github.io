The Continuum is a new Flash game, featuring an extremely polished interface and deep ranking system. The game is the first to come from Chicago-based development studio Seven Lights, and has been in production for over 18 months.

> The Continuum isn't meant for casual gamers - rather, it's aimed at a more hardcore audience, mixing elements from traditional table top card games, RPGs, and turn based strategy. Each player builds up a virtual "deck" of in-game characters, each of which can be customized with various skills and attributes.
