<p>Adobe today announced <a href="http://www.photoshop.com/express/">Adobe Photoshop Express</a> public beta, a free Rich Internet Application available to anyone who wants to store, sort and show off digital photos with eye-catching effects.</p>
<p>As the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200803/032708PhotoshopExpress.html">newest addition</a> to the Photoshop family line, Photoshop Express has taken much of Adobe's best image editing technology and made it simple and accessible to a new online audience. Photoshop Express allows users to store up to <strong>2GB</strong> of images online for free, make edits to their photos, and share them online, including downloading and uploading photos from popular social networking sites like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> and <a href="http://www.photobucket.com/">Photobucket</a> to start with. More integration with other online Digital Photo Destinations are expected in future.</p>
<p><strong>Simple and Easy to Use</strong></p>
<p>Upload your photos, edit them and play around by preserving the original image and share it with anybody. Adobe Photoshop Express features standard edits -- remove blemishes and red-eye, convert to black and white, crop and resize, etc.</p>
<p>Other one-touch approach like Pop Color enables you to select an object in an image, mutes the background color of the photo and allows the user to swap the object's color so it jumps off the page. Sketch effects help photos look like drawings and the Distort feature allows you to distort facial features or objects within the images for a comical or artistic effect.</p>
