Earlier, it was the awesome Keynote on the Web -- <a href="http://280slides.com/">280 Slides</a>. Now, its -- <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a> -- an open source framework that makes it easy to build desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.</p>
<p><strong>280 Slides</strong></p>
<p>280 Slides enables anyone with a web browser to quickly and easily create beautiful presentations. 280 Slides takes advantage of the web by making it trivial to find and include great media in your presentation. There are also built in advanced features like importing and exporting PowerPoint documents, so your data is always portable.</p>
<p><strong>Cappuccino</strong></p>
<p>Along with Objective-J, <strong>Cappuccino</strong> provides a complete toolkit to develop rich web applications. Its open sourced under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>.<!--more--><br />
<blockquote>Cappuccino is built on top of standard web technologies like JavaScript, and it implements most of the familiar APIs from GNUstep and Apple's Cocoa frameworks. When you program in Cappuccino, you don't need to concern yourself with the complexities of traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, or even the DOM. The unpleasantries of building complex cross browser applications are abstracted away for you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cappuccino was implemented using a new programming language called Objective-J, which is modelled after Objective-C and built entirely on top of JavaScript. Programs written in Objective-J are interpreted in the client, so no compilation or plugins are required. Objective-J is released alongside Cappuccino under the LGPL.</p>
<p>With Cappuccino, you don't need to know HTML. You'll never write a line of CSS. You don't ever have interact with DOM. Developers need to learn one technology, Objective-J, and one set of APIs. Plus, these technologies are implementations of well known and well understood existing ones. Developers can leverage decades of collective experience to really accelerate the pace of building rich web applications.</p>
<p>Cappuccino and Objective-J run in any modern web browser, including:</p>
