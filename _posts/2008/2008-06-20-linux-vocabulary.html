</div>
<p>We have seen a large number of mundane, how-to articles on Linux in the <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/author/praval/">past few days</a> on this website. Having a strong belief that it would have helped the geeks and pro's to brush up their skills and the newbies to dirty their hands with at least a few Linux distro's, let's move on to a different stage today where we shall learn and remember some basic terminologies which we would probably come across in day-to-day Linux world.</p>
<p>Remember, there is no limit to this list. Henceforth, I'll try to add whatever I can at this point of time. I wish this article was a Wiki page so that all you Linux lovers can update it to keep it fresh, forever! However, you may append any new words you come across as a comment to this post.</p>
<p><strong>Here we go in an alphabetical order:</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>APT:</strong> Advanced Packaging Tool.This tool is responsible for simplification of process which involves managing packages on Linux by automating the retrieval, configuration and installation. Generally, you'll find APT on a Debian based distro.<br />
* <strong>Bash:</strong> Bourne Again Shell is generally known to be the default shell in most Linux distributions. When someone refers to a shell or the command line it is the Bash shell what they are usually referring to.<br />
* <strong>CLI:</strong> The CLI is known as the Command Line Interface. When you open a terminal, or if you do not use a Window Manager, or X11, you are operating on what is often abbreviated as the CLI.<br />
* <strong>Dependency:</strong> A application, library, or development set that a package depends upon to work.<br />
* <strong>Distro:</strong> A short form of - Distribution, a distro is a set of programs combined with the Linux kernel which together creates an Operating System.<br />
* <strong>GNOME:</strong> It is one of the few available desktop environment for Linux. Gnome is the default desktop on the popular Ubuntu distribution, which we have referred to in our previous articles.<br />
* <strong>GRUB:</strong> It is a boot loader for Linux. Allows users to have several different Operating Systems on their system at once, and choose which one to run when the computer boots.<br />
* <strong>KDE:</strong> KDE or the K Desktop Environment, is desktop environment for Linux workstations, something similar to GNOME but different visualization and default set of applications and tools.<br />
* <strong>Kernel:</strong> The core, or the brain of a Linux operating system. The kernel is what controls the hardware and makes them interact with the software. It is what every Linux distro is built upon.<br />
* <strong>LILO:</strong> Linux Loader is pretty similar to Grub in its functionality. However, different in terms of its fabrication. LILO is again a boot loader for Linux. LILO usually writes to the Master Boot Record (MBR) on your device.<br />
* <strong>Linus Torvalds:</strong> I doubt you'll need this! But the letter "L" reminds me his name before anything else. The man who wrote the first Linux kernel in 1991.<br />
* <strong>Man:</strong> Short form for manual. If you need some help about an available command on the terminal, just type - <code>man (command name)</code>.<br />
* <strong>Root:</strong> The superuser account on all Linux systems.<br />
* <strong>RPM:</strong> A package manager, which can be used to build, install, verify, update, and remove individual software packages. RPM is used by default on the Red Hat and Fedora distributions.<br />
* <strong>Sudo:</strong> Stands for Super User DO and allows a user to have a temporary root access without logging in as root.<br />
* <strong>Tux:</strong> The name of the Linux mascot - A Penguin.<br />
* <strong>YAST:</strong> Stands for Yet Another Setup Tool. Typically used on the SuSE distro. Yast is a setup and configuration tool.<br />
* <strong>YUM:</strong> An automated update program which can be used for maintaining systems using rpm. Yum is also used on Red Hat and Fedora by default.<br />
* <strong>X / X11:</strong> Also known as the X Window System, X is a windowing system that provides the standard toolkit and protocol with which to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs). KDE and GNOME are built upon X11.</p>
<p>The list is endless, keep pouring in your comments and suggestions. Remember, more than actually being difficult, Linux has been taught to be so. We would like to adhere to a new statement saying, <em>Linux is different and not necessarily difficult.</em></p>
