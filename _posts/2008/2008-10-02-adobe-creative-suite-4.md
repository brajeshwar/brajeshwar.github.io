<p><!--more-->With one of its biggest software release, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/suiteselector/">Adobe Creative Suite 4</a>, Adobe is on a mission to bring "Radical Workflow Breakthroughs, New Levels of Flash Expressiveness and Integration Anchor."</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Suite Master Collection CS4 combines virtually all of Adobe's new design and development applications, technologies and services in a single box -- the most comprehensive creative environment ever delivered.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200809/092308AdobeCS4Family.html">Press Release</a>;</p>
<blockquote><p>A simplified workflow in Adobe Creative Suite 4 enables users to design across media more efficiently by making it easier to complete common tasks and switch between mediums without leaving a project. InDesign CS4 includes a new Live Preflight tool that allows designers to catch production errors and a newly customizable Links panel to place files more efficiently. The revolutionary new Content-Aware Scaling tool in Photoshop CS4 and Photoshop CS4 Extended automatically recomposes an image as it is resized, preserving vital areas as it adapts to new dimensions. An expanded version of Dynamic Link in CS4 Production Premium enables users to move content between After Effects CS4, Adobe Premiere Pro CS4, Soundbooth CS4, and Encore CS4, so updates can be seen instantly without rendering.</p></blockquote>
<p>Designers using the Adobe Creative Suite 4 product family will be able to gain unprecedented creative control using the new expressive features and visual performance improvements in Adobe Flash Player 10 to deliver breakthrough Web experiences across multiple browsers and operating systems.</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Suite 4 brings 3D center-stage providing the ability to paint, composite, and animate 3D models using familiar tools. Flash CS4 Professional now offers the ability to apply tweens to objects instead of keyframes, providing greater control over animation attributes. Also in Flash, the new Bones tool helps create more realistic animations between linked objects. With a searchable library of more than 450 dynamically updated device profiles from leading manufacturers, Adobe Device Central CS4 enables users to easily test mobile content designed using many of the Creative Suite 4 products.</p>
<p>On Apple's MacBook Air or the latest generation MacBook Pros, Photoshop CS4 supports multi-touch gestures. Using your multi-touch trackpad in CS4 lets you rotate, pinch to zoom, and even "throw" images across the screen.</p>
