# FreshAIRApps

<a href="http://www.jameswhittaker.com/">James Whittaker</a>'s FreshAIRApps is not just a website that showcase some of the best and popular Adobe AIR Applications but also provides the community with AIR updates, tutorials and other resources.

The Showcase is the main attraction at <a href="http://freshairapps.com/">FreshAIRApps</a>. It gives a review of an AIR app and allows users to provide opinions in the comments and rate the apps. Users/Visitors can also submit an AIR app for reviewing.

FreshAIRApps is perhaps the first of its kind to concentrate totally on Adobe AIR. It might just prove to be a great resource site for the Adobe AIR developer and designer community.
