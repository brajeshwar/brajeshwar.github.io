<p>Mike Chamber got a nice BIG printable PDF reference guide -- <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/articles/atp_ria_guide.html">Adobe technology platform ActionScript reference for RIA development</a>, and it provides a complete ActionScript 3 API listing for Flash Player, Adobe AIR and Flex 3.<br />
<br />
The guide is around 50 pages, and is meant to be printed out on comic book glossy stock. Adobe will be printing some out over the next couple of months, so you may be able to pick them up at various events and conferences.</p>
<p>The document was created with Adobe InDesign, and <a href="http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2008/03/17/actionscript-3-ria-reference-guide/">Mike is planning</a> to post the source files in case anyone wants to update it.</p>
