# Touch Typing

[Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) is an [open-source](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype) minimalistic and customizable typing test. It features many test modes, an account system to save your typing speed history, and user-configurable features such as themes, sounds, a smooth caret, and more. Monkeytype attempts to emulate the experience of natural keyboard typing during a typing test, by unobtrusively presenting the text prompts and displaying typed characters in-place, providing straightforward, real-time feedback on typos, speed, and accuracy.

[TypeRacer](https://typeracer.com) allows people to race each-other by typing quotes from books, movies, and songs. It is the first multiplayer typing game on the web.

https://www.keybr.com will help you to learn touch typing which means typing through muscle memory without using your eyesight to find the keys. It can improve your typing speed and accuracy dramatically. The opposite is hunt and peck typing, a method of typing in which you look at the keyboard instead of the screen, and use only the index fingers.

[TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com) is a web-based program that teaches you how to type with fun games, videos and challenges. You can practice with different languages, keyboard layouts and stories, and track your progress with stars and badges.
