[^VibeCoding]: AI-Assisted Coding or [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) refers to the use of artificial intelligence tools, like large language models, to help developers with tasks such as writing, reviewing, and debugging code. These tools can significantly improve coding efficiency and quality by providing suggestions and automating repetitive tasks.
