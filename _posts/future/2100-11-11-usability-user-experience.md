# Brilliant Usability and User Experience of Today

Usability, as defined by Wikipedia, is "the capacity of a system to provide a condition for its users to perform the tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience."

"The primary notion of usability is that an object designed with a generalized users' psychology and physiology in mind is, for example:

More efficient to use — takes less time to accomplish a particular task.
Easier to learn — operation can be learned by observing the object.
More satisfying to use."

In short, usability is the ease with which a predetermined task can be accomplished.
