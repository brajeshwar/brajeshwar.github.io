# WordPress - a Personal Note

This is a very personal note about my journey with WordPress. This article is here to serve as a history for my association with WordPress. It has nothing to do with any story in and around WordPress in the past, present, or future.

WordPress was released on May 27, 2003, by its founders, [Matt Mullenweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg) and [Mike Little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Little). [WordPress Foundation](https://wordpressfoundation.org) owns WordPress, WordPress projects, and other related trademarks.

Disclaimer: I was also a long-time WP-Engine customer and my account was grandfathered forever. Unfortunately, with my site moving away from WordPress, I stopped using them.
