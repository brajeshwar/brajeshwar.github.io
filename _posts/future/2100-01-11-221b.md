I got my first introduction and was super excited about a detective story in school, and if I can recollect, it must have been 4th grade. I retraced my memory and the pieces of stories from that—it was Sherlock Holmes in [The Adventure of the Three Students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Three_Students) by [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle).

[221B Baker Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/221B_Baker_Street) is the London address of detective Sherlock Holmes. In the United Kingdom, postal addresses with a number followed by a letter may indicate a separate address within a larger, often residential building. Baker Street was a high-class residential district in the late 19th century, and Holmes’s apartment would probably have been part of a Georgian terrace.

The residence was first introduced in [A Study in Scarlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet) (1887). When the Holmes stories were published, Baker Street addresses were not as high as 221. Baker Street was extended later, and in 1932, the Abbey National Building Society moved into premises at 219–229 Baker Street.

> We met the next day as he had arranged and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street, which he had spoken about at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a large, airy sitting room, cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad windows.
