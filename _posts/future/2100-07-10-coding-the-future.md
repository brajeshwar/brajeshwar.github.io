So far, the team at Coding the Future are from USA, India, and they are opening up to more instructors and team members.

Classes run for 4 months, with sessions beginning in September, January, and June, meeting once a week. Each session consists of 40 minutes of online courses. In the classes, high school and university students teach groups of 5-10 students on a topic of common interest. These classes are designed for middle and high school students with varying levels of computer science knowledge and experience. Cohorts of students are grouped by skill level, availability, and coding language.
