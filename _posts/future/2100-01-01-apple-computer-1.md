# Apple Computer 1

The Apple Computer 1 (Apple-1), later known predominantly as the Apple I, is an 8-bit motherboard-only personal computer designed by [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak) and released by [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) in 1976. Production was discontinued on September 30, 1977.

The Apple I was one of the first computers available that used the inexpensive MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor. An expansion included a BASIC interpreter, allowing users to utilize BASIC at home instead of at institutions with mainframe computers, greatly lowering the entry cost for computing with BASIC.
