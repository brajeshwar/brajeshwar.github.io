Read a nice article [Status Limbo](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/status-limbo) ([archive](https://archive.ph/KZoZZ)) by [Anu Atluru](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anuatluru/).

Status limbo is a state of ambiguity and future uncertainty about your status, both in your estimation and as perceived by others.

It is a state of being that’s frequented by those we admire, both for their remarkable achievements and inspiring journeys. Even if you don’t identify with this archetype, status limbo seems to be a universal human experience that we all have more than once in a lifetime.

While temporary, if you can understand and accept its inherent trade-offs, status limbo can be an incredibly meaningful time of free exploration, personal development, and professional growth — and an all-around transformative period.
