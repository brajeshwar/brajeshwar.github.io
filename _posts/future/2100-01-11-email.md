[Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) is the the most important written form of communication and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

[Zawinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski)'s Law: Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.

The sweet spot for having control over your email while simultaneously minimizing unforseen headaches is to simply own your domain name and point the MX record to whatever hosting provider you want instead of self-hosting a server at home.
