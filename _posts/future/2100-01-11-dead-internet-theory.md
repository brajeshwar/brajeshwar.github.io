# Dead Internet Theory

I wasn’t very concerned with the Dead Internet Theory[^deadInternettheory], until my daughter mentioned it asking for my views.

[^deadInternettheory]: The [dead Internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) asserts that, due to a coordinated and intentional effort, the Internet now consists mainly of bot activity and automatically generated content manipulated by algorithmic curation. The date given for this “death” is generally around 2016 or 2017.
