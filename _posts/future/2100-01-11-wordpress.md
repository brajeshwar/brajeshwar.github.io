# WordPress - a Personal Note

This is a very personal note and my own journey with WordPress. This article is here to serve as a history for my association with WordPress. This has nothing to do with the evolving story of the incidents in and around WordPress.

Disclaimer: I was also a long-time WP-Engine customer and my account was grandfathered forever. Unfortunately, with my site moving away from WordPress, I stopped using them.
