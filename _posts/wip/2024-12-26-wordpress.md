# WordPress - a Personal Note

This is a very personal note about my journey with WordPress. This article is here to serve as a history for my association with WordPress. It has nothing to do with any story in and around WordPress in the past, present, or future.

WordPress was released on May 27, 2003, by its founders, [Matt Mullenweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg) and [Mike Little](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Little). [WordPress Foundation](https://wordpressfoundation.org) owns WordPress, WordPress projects, and other related trademarks.

My fondest memory of WordPress is that of the times when we needed to have another separate instance of its installation just to get a separate pages, such as an About Page.

I still have my [WordPress profile](https://profiles.wordpress.org/brajeshwar/) listing some of my works. However, a few of my plugins and themes have been sold or transferred.

Disclaimer: I was also a long-time WP-Engine customer, and my account was grandfathered forever. Unfortunately, my site moved away from WordPress, so I stopped using them.
