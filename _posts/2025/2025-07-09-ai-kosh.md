Recently, I stumbled across India’s data initiative for AI initiatives, [AI Kosh](https://aikosh.indiaai.gov.in/). It is proposed as the “central nervous system” of the IndiaAI Mission: a national library of non-personal Indian datasets, a try-before-you-buy model sets, and subsidised GPU compute into one platform.

A bold vision, but it is still very early. The site still feels like a work-in-progress; most pages are thin, a mandatory sign-in is required, and discoverability is still evolving.

> “AI Kosh is a unified hub where startups, researchers, and developers can discover, access, and integrate high-quality, India-relevant datasets, models, toolkits, and an in-browser sandbox.”

Quite a few interesting datasets are already available.

- **Expression-of-Interest (EOI).** Any accredited organisation can submit non-personal, anonymised datasets, models, or use-cases, retaining control over licensing tiers (open, registered, or restricted).
- **Academic Heavy-Hitters.** IIT-Bombay alone has uploaded over 30+ artefacts, including a 2.18-lakh-sentence corpus that simplifies classical Sanskrit, astronomy, and medicine texts dating back 18 centuries.
- **Responsible-AI Toolkits.** Four bias-mitigation and risk-assessment solutions developed under the Safe & Trusted AI pillar will go live soon.

I also saw benefits galore.

- **Subsidised GPU Hours.** The companion Compute Portal offers 40% discounted access to H100, MI300X, and Gaudi-2 GPUs under long-term empanelment contracts. 
- **Startup on-ramp.** 60+startups have already applied for subsidised compute; three to five will be fast-tracked, paying just about ₹60 (sub-dollar) per GPU-hour. 
- **Road to Sovereignty.** The government is working with industry to build indigenous GPUs within three to four years, reinforcing compute self-reliance.

[AI Kosh](https://aikosh.indiaai.gov.in/) is definitely a step forward for an inclusive, and responsible AI infrastructure for India.
