I remember starting my novel-reading journey in school. [Sidney Sheldon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Sheldon) was one of my favorite author. Unfortunately, as I grow older, I realized that these genre of novels are kinda cheesy, shallow, and not really my type anymore. I re-read two of his books — [Master of the Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Game_(novel)) and [The Sands of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sands_of_Time_(Sheldon_novel)).

The Accidental Masterpiece by [Michael Kimmelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kimmelman) reimagines art as a natural part of daily life, found in unexpected places. The book explores how ordinary people create “accidental masterpieces” in the routines and imperfections of life, showing that creativity often springs from experimentation and serendipity. It draws parallels between art and scientific discovery, fueled by curiosity and unexpected insights. Learn to embrace imperfection; beauty often emerges from risk-taking and the willingness to make mistakes. People find artistic joy in the mundane, like photographing clutter or repurposing broken objects. Creativity isn’t only about the final product but finding meaning and beauty in the process. This inspiring approach brings curiosity and reflection into every aspect of life, seeing art in order and chaos.
