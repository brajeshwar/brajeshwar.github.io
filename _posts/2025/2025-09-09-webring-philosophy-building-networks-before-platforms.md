# The Webring Philosophy: Building Networks Before Platforms

In the late 1990s, before platforms captured our online attention, the [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) gave people a way to connect their sites. The concept was simple: link related websites into a circular network, with each pointing to the next, creating an endless loop. It felt like the internet’s version of a block party, where everyone contributed their quirks, designs, and obsessions.  

You didn’t need venture capital, a backend team, or what Startups now call network effects. You only required HTML, a snippet of copied code, and a willingness to connect with strangers across the digital landscape.  

## How Webrings Worked

A webring formed a decentralized network. Each participating site displayed a small widget, mostly, at the bottom of the page;

`Previous` \| `Next` \| `Random` \| `Join`

Visitors clicked through the loop, sometimes landing on tightly themed pages, sometimes stumbling into chaos.  

Some rings celebrated [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) or [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). Others revolved around anime fan art, gothic poetry, or [zine culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine). Users could jump into hundreds of handcrafted sites rooted in niche subcultures.  

No central algorithm filtered content. No single authority dictated visibility. Participation itself drove discovery.  

## A Precursor to Platforms

Today, centralized platforms like [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook), [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube), [TikTok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok), [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter), and [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn) dominate online experience. They promise networks and distribution, but they flatten individuality and dictate rules. Algorithms control visibility, design systems suppress personality, and monetization depends on the host’s terms.  

Webrings offered networks without platforms. Links created the social graph by consent. No one site controlled another. The “platform” existed only as a thin connection layer.  

## Lessons for Product Builders

- **Build with lightweight infrastructure.** Webrings ran on HTML and goodwill, not data centers. Builders often over-engineer. Sometimes, a shared protocol or minimal connector is sufficient.  
- **Protect ownership.** In a ring, each page remained under its creator’s control. No feed swallowed it. Builders experimenting with [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)), the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), or [IndieWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWeb) can borrow this balance of autonomy and connection.  
- **Value discovery over reach.** Webrings encouraged exploration, not impressions. They created rabbit holes of obscure sites that would fail under today’s growth-hacking logic. Builders should ask if frictionless virality always serves the best interests of users.  
- **Let communities govern themselves.** Strong rings are self-curated. Members admitted peers and filtered outsiders. This local trust model contrasts with centralized moderation at scale. Builders can learn that smaller groups often regulate themselves more effectively.  

## The Decentralized Ethos

In hindsight, webrings foreshadowed the [decentralized web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_web). They distributed power peer to peer. They relied on protocols more than platforms and relationships more than algorithms.  

It’s no surprise that nostalgia for webrings resurfaces alongside federated networks and decentralized tools. Both pursue the same goal: to build networks without kings.  

## Why It Still Matters

Founders and product builders operate in an age of platform dominance. The easy move is to build the next walled garden, capture users, and chase retention with algorithmic nudges. The webring demonstrates another approach: leveraging trust, curiosity, and straightforward links to establish lasting value.  

The internet started as a network of networks, not as a bundle of apps. Webrings expressed that philosophy most clearly. They may look primitive now, but their ethos still applies: empower participants, keep infrastructure lean, and let networks emerge from connection rather than control.
