# Designing for Ephemerality

There’s a melancholy in watching software die. One day, it’s the tool you swear by, shaping your work and your life. The next, it’s sunsetted, acquired and dismantled, or quietly abandoned in a forgotten GitHub repo. If you’ve been on the internet long enough, you’ve buried many of your digital companions, such as [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)), [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader), [ICQ](/2024/icq/), [Winamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp), and countless others that once felt eternal.

And yet, all software dies.

The paradox is that we build with pride, obsessing over design and architecture, as if our product will outlast us. But deep down, we know the truth: [software is ephemeral](/2025/internet-ephemerality/). It has a life cycle, birth, growth, maintenance, decline, and death. The only difference between software and living organisms is that sometimes death comes by acquisition, pivot, or pure neglect rather than old age.

The fundamental design challenge, then, is not just about creating useful software. It’s about designing for ephemerality.

## The Ghosts of Code Past

I remember the thrill of signing into [MSN Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Messenger) and hearing that cheerful “ding” when a friend came online. I remember building playlists on Winamp, tweaking skins. I remember the comfort of Google Reader, that one place where the entire internet flowed neatly into my morning ritual.

These weren’t just apps. They were environments. They shaped how we thought, interacted, and even remembered the world. Their absence isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a small grief, like moving away from a town you loved and realizing you can never really go back.

The ephemerality of software isn’t just a technical fact. It’s a cultural loss.

## Building Knowing It Will Die

So what do we do as builders? Do we give up and stop caring? Hardly. Designing for ephemerality is about building with grace.

1. **Build with Pride, Release with Humility.** Every line of code, every pixel you push into the world, should be crafted with care. Not because it will live forever, but because while it lives, it deserves dignity. Like sand mandalas[^SandMandala] painstakingly created by monks only to be blown away, the art is in the making as much as the keeping.
2. **Prepare for Exit Paths.** Users should never feel trapped. Data should be portable. Workflows should have alternatives. The saddest thing is not that software dies, it’s when users are left stranded. Design as if one day your users will have to move on. Because they will.
3. **Leave Artifacts, Not Ruins.** Documentation, open-source releases, archived APIs—these are the fossils of your work. They let future generations learn, remix, and maybe even resurrect. Don’t let your product disappear without a trace.
4. **Treat Longevity as a Bonus, Not a Guarantee.** If your software lives for a decade, celebrate. If it lives two, you’ve achieved a miracle. Don’t measure success by imagined immortality. Measure it by the depth of its impact in its time.

## Nostalgia as Design Principle

[Killed by Google](https://killedbygoogle.com) is a list of tools, utilities, and products by Google, which were eventually sunsetted.

There’s a strange power in nostalgia. When designing for ephemerality, nostalgia becomes both a guide and a warning. Nostalgia teaches us what people really valued. The rituals, communities, and small moments of joy. These are timeless design anchors.

A warning, because nostalgia can trap us in longing for what’s gone instead of building what’s next. Holding on too tightly to the past leads to stagnation, not innovation.

Think about how many “Google Reader replacements” cropped up, each promising to revive what was lost. None truly recaptured its magic. Because the magic wasn’t just in the app; it was in that time, that context, that version of the internet.

Designers and engineers must accept this: you cannot recreate the past. You can only design for the present with an awareness that it, too, will fade.

## The Philosophy of Impermanence

There’s a [Japanese aesthetic](/2025/japanese-aesthetics/) concept, wabi-sabi, which embraces impermanence and imperfection. A cracked ceramic bowl, repaired with gold, becomes more beautiful precisely because of its fragility and history.

Software can take a similar path. We shouldn’t hide the fact that apps will age, features will break, and eventually, the servers will shut down. Instead, we can design experiences that respect this cycle.

Imagine apps that gently guide users towards exporting their data as they near the end-of-life. Or design systems that celebrate their own milestones, “10 years of service” badges, not as vanity metrics but as acknowledgements of shared journeys.

Impermanence doesn’t diminish value. It gives it weight.

## Regrets, We’ve Had a Few

Personally, I regret not archiving more. Screenshots, workflows, and even just writing down what it felt like to use certain software. When Google Reader shut down, I thought I’d find something better. I never did. When Flickr lost its spark, I lost not just a photo album but a community.

I regret not saying a proper goodbye to some of the tools that shaped me. In chasing the new, I often neglected to thank the old. If software teaches us anything, it’s to practice gratitude in real time. Not later. Now.

## Designing With the End in Mind

When you know your work won’t last, it changes how you design. You focus less on making it perfect and more on making it meaningful. You stop chasing immortality and start chasing impact. You treat users not as captive customers but as fellow travelers, who will one day move on.

Designing for ephemerality is not an admission of defeat. It’s an act of maturity. We know it won’t last forever, but while it lasts, let’s make it beautiful, functional, and human.

[^SandMandala]: [Sand Mandala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mandala) is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition involving the creation and destruction of mandalas made from colored sand. Once complete, the sand mandala’s ritualistic dismantling is accompanied by ceremonies and viewing to symbolize Buddhist doctrinal belief in the transitory nature of material life.
