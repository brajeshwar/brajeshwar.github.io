I used to host a Flash Game, some sort of, Bubble Wrap Bubble Popper. Unfortunately, it went away along with Flash. I have been meaning to have a playable Bubble Popping Game.

I’ve been playing with AI-assisted coding for the past few days. Here is a simple webpage with a playable Bubble Popper. This was done between dinner and sleep. I had to sleep a bit late, and the result wasn’t that bad.

`Note:` [Zed](https://zed.dev) (IDE), paired with OpenAI’s [GPT-4.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4.1) as the coding assistant. The total from project scaffolding to first production `git push` was $6.34. The user-facing website is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) via [Github](https://github.com). I was trying to avoid hand-writing any code but I did end up cleaning a bit here and there. I even asked the AI-Assistant to commit and push to Github.
