One of the items in my weekly [Digital Chores](/2025/digital-chores/) is to “Restart Devices.”

Often times, I miss the routine but it’s okay to do it next week. Many devices have options to schedule reboots. Otherwise, it is as easy as logging into an admin interface and pressing a button, or in some cases pressing a physical button on a device.

Quite a lot of technical issues can be resolved by simply rebooting the device.

But why the hell does it just works?

There are many reasons, and some of them are;

- **Clears Memory.** Modern electronics and computers rely on processes running in memory. Over time, temporary data or cache or state data can become corrupted or misaligned. This can lead to unexpected behavior, slowdowns, or complete system crashes. When a device is restarted, its memory is cleared, giving it a fresh slate to start from.
- **Plugging Memory Leaks.** Some applications don’t manage memory efficiently. A memory leak happens when a program uses up memory but doesn’t release it properly when it’s no longer needed. Over time, these leaks can accumulate, slowing down your device or causing it to crash. Rebooting it can clear up the leaked memory and restore performance.
- **Resets Connections.** Operating systems and electronic devices rely on numerous background services and daemons to function properly. Sometimes, one or more of these services stop working correctly due to bugs or conflicts. Restarting the device shuts down all services and reinitializes them to connect to networks or peripherals that may have failed.
- **Hardware Reinitialization.** Restarting a device not only resets software; it also resets hardware states. Specific components like GPUs, sensors, and I/O controllers can end up in bad states or become unresponsive. Power cycling (completely turning the device off and on) can reinitialize these components.
- **Software Updates and Configuration Changes.** Many system updates and configuration changes don’t take effect until after a reboot. Restarting helps apply those changes correctly.
- **Restores Functionality.** A process can become “hung” or stuck due to errors or resource conflicts. While it might not respond to termination requests, a restart forcibly ends all processes and allows them to start cleanly again.
