# Lullaby Language

I stumbled on the article, [Lullaby Language](https://www.humansystemsinaction.com/lullaby-language/) by [Jerry Weinberg](https://geraldmweinberg.com). Here is an extract of the keywords that confuse teams involved in projects working together and the better ways of dealing with the situation.

## Should

The meaning of “should” would be “probably won’t.”

For instance, the sentence, “The Catalog Department **should** deliver component pricing data by 1 February to the IT Department.”

`Team-A` interprets this as “The Catalog Department **[must]** deliver component pricing data by 1 February to the IT Department.”

`Team-B` interprets this as “The Catalog Department **[will make every effort to]** deliver component pricing data by 1 February to the IT Department.”

The meaning with using `should` is now, “The Catalog Department **[probably won’t]** deliver component pricing data by 1 February to the IT Department.”

## Just

Between the sentences;

“Next time we’ll **just** let you know what we really need.”

and

“Next time we’ll let you know what we really need.”

that **just** makes it sound like there won’t be any problems. It discounts the difficulty.

These are “Lullaby Word.” Like ‘should,’ it lulls your mind into a false sense of security. A better translation of ‘just’ would have been, ‘have a lot of trouble to.'”

## Soon

Another lullaby is “soon” which translates to a vague timeline and no definitives. When someone ask you when, and the answer is “Soon”, it means , “I don’t know, but don’t keep bothering me.”

## Very

Adding ‘very’ is like adding a sleeping pill to the lullaby. It makes it even more certain that it’s going to be a long, long time. Maybe never.

## Only

“It’s only a one line change.” makes it sound like — “That is, I didn’t think much about what could go wrong.”

## Anything

“I didn’t change anything.” translates to, “That is, anything I thought was important.”

## All

All I gotta do is … [A synonym for “just.”]
