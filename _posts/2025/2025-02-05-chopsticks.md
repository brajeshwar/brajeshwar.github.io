# Chopsticks

I grew up loving English-dubbed Chinese Kung-Fu Shaolin action movies. In those movies, I saw kung fu masters using chopsticks to not just eat rice from a bowl but catch flies mid-air. I always wanted to master the art and habit of using Chopsticks. Unfortunately, in my formative years of the 90s, I never had access to or seen Chopsticks in India.

In 2005, I was introduced to one in a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles. I had the opportunity that started with an embarrassment — I asked for a fork and spoon. They had to scramble and took some time to find me a set. They also gave me a pair of Training Chopsticks.

Later, I bought a bunch and trained enough to be comfortable using them. Ever since I have always had a bunch of chopsticks as part of my kitchen utensils. They are one of the most versatile items in the kitchen. Even in 2025, I’m somewhat surprised that Chopsticks are rare items in the kitchens of Indian families. I strongly suggest keeping them around even if you don’t eat with them regularly.

This pair of humble sticks that can simultaneously make you feel like a culinary ninja or an uncoordinated toddler. Used by billions worldwide for thousands of years, these utensils are the ultimate multitaskers, seamlessly transitioning from tool to tradition, and sometimes, a weapon against unruly noodles.

## History

Wikipedia states that the [Chopsticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks) originated in ancient China about 5,000 years ago, primarily as cooking tools to stir pots and pluck morsels from boiling water. Around 400 CE, they graduated to dining utensils when food prep became more bite-sized, thanks to the scarcity of cooking fuel.

From China, chopsticks spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, each region customizing its design. The Japanese opted for shorter, pointed tips for grabbing delicate fish bones, while Koreans prefer metal chopsticks—possibly because steel is better at both picking up kimchi and intimidating table thieves.

## Don’t be a Tourist

Using chopsticks is simple but can make you feel like you’ve never had fingers before. Here is how you can get started;

1. Grip the first stick like a pencil/pen.
2. Balance the second stick below the first. This one doesn’t move, so think of it as the supporting stick.
3. Pinch food between the sticks.

Chopsticks are elegant, versatile, and eco-friendly. They are ideal for picking up rice grains, flipping pancakes, or eating chips and Cheetos without dirtying your fingers. However, while dining with others, be aware of some of the general Chopstics’ cultural etiquette.

- Don’t stick them upright in your rice. This resembles funeral rituals in many Asian cultures and might get you side-eyes.
- Don’t use them as drumsticks on the table.
- Don’t point with chopsticks.

Chopsticks are more than utensils—they’re a cultural icon, a rite of passage, and a test of patience for the uninitiated. Whether fumbling through your first plate of dumplings or expertly twirling noodles like a pro, chopsticks remind us that dining is as much about skill as sustenance.
