Baskerville is a typeface that I love. It is a highly readable font. It was one of my go-to typefaces while I was in school and college, as I worked part-time in printing and designing for the print media.

[Baskerville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskerville) is a [serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif) typeface designed in 1757 by [John Baskerville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Baskerville) in Birmingham, England. Baskerville is classified as a transitional typeface, intended as a refinement of what are now called old-style typefaces of the period, especially those of his most eminent contemporary, [William Caslon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Caslon).

[Libre Baskerville](https://web.archive.org/web/20151025081726/http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/libre-baskerville) draws inspiration from the classic typeface. The modern adaptation is optimized for on-screen reading with a taller x-height, wider counters and lower stroke contrast.

Libre Baskerville is an open-source adaptation and is free to use. [Google Fonts has a hosted version](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville).
