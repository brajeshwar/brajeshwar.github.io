# Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

That sounds like the kind of thing a Navy SEAL instructor would growl at you before you fumble with your gun clip for the fourth time. Which, coincidentally, is precisely where it comes from.

Before you roll your eyes and mumble, “Yeah, yeah, another macho aphorism,” let’s unwrap this one. Slowly. Smoothly.

## The Fastest People ain’t in a Hurry

Ever seen a Formula One pit crew? They change four tires, refuel, wipe the windshield, and maybe tuck in the driver’s seatbelt, all in under three seconds. But look closely. Their movements are rehearsed, calm, and almost elegant. No fumbling, no flailing, no shouting, “Where’s the damn wrench?” That’s smooth.

Now, contrast that with how most startups operate when their funding lands. Chaos, caffeine, and calendar invite flying everywhere. The CTO is rewriting the backend in Rust “for performance,” the designer is redesigning to add dark mode, and someone decided to migrate to a new analytics platform mid-launch. That’s not smooth. That’s a 7-car pileup in the productivity lane.

## But Why the Busy-ness of Speed

We equate speed with progress. “Move fast and break things,” said a famous social network. But breaking things also means someone has to clean them up. That costs time, momentum, and morale. Now, your fast has turned into a very slow walk of shame past a pile of Jira tickets.

You know who gets this right? Japanese tea masters. Ever watched them make tea? It’s like watching time itself slow down and stretch into serenity. Every movement is intentional and unhurried, and in that slowness, you find grace. That’s not inefficiency. That’s mastery.

## In Code, in Craft, in Crisis

For developers, this is gospel. Do you want to go fast? Write less code. Think through your architecture. Use fewer dependencies. Don’t [YOLO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Only_Look_Once) your PR with 147 file changes and call it “cleaning up.” That’s not fast. That’s future-you quietly cursing current-you from a debug session at 3 AM.

The same goes for founders. Do you want to scale? First, ensure your fundamentals are smooth, including onboarding, product fit, and team dynamics. Scale a mess, and all you get is a bigger mess, now with customer support tickets.

Even in emergencies, the calm ones win. You don’t want the surgeon who rushes in yelling, “Scalpel!” like it’s an action movie. You want the one who looks like she’s setting up a picnic but has already saved your life by minute three.

## Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

Here’s the thing. “Slow is smooth” isn’t about dragging your feet. It’s about removing the friction that slows you down later. It’s the code that doesn’t break. The meetings that end early. The feature that works right the first time. It’s the calm hand in chaos, the pause before pressing send.

Anyone can be fast once. But to be sustainably fast? You have to be smooth. And to be smooth, you’ve got to start slow.

So the next time you’re tempted to rush something, take a breath. Tie your shoelaces. Make some tea. Then move. Smoothly.
