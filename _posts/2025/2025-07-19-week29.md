[EXT](https://docs.ext.store) is a platform that allows third party developers to install, load, run, publish and monetize JavaScript-based extensions and native modules, while giving end-users complete control over each extensionâ€™s permissions. EXT also includes a [store](https://ext.store) where end-users can find and purchase approved extensions (though the platform also allows side-loading private extensions and modules).

End-of-life (EOL) and support information is often hard to track, or very badly presented. [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date) documents EOL dates and support lifecycles for various products.
