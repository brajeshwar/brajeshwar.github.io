# Entrepreneurs - Gatling Gun, Shotgun, or Sniper

Entrepreneurs have different approaches to working on their ideas and have distinct styles, strategies, and mindsets. In my personal journey,  based on their execution styles, if asked to pick a choice of their firearms, they would be the bearers of either a Gatling Gun, a Shotgun, or a Sniper Rifle.

## Gatling Gun

The Gatling Gun entrepreneur is characterized by rapid-fire action, constantly launching new ideas, features, or marketing initiatives. Their playbook lies in volume, iterating quickly and covering a broad scope of opportunities simultaneously. They rely heavily on trial and error, quickly abandoning ideas that donâ€™t immediately show promise.

The Gatling Gun approach often generates substantial market feedback due to sheer volume and quick iterations. This enables rapid pivoting and refinement, particularly in highly uncertain or rapidly evolving markets.

However, this approach risks spreading resources too thin. Without sufficient focus, potentially excellent ideas may fail due to inadequate execution or follow-through.

## Shotgun

The Shotgun entrepreneur adopts a slightly more focused yet still broad approach. They target a general market segment or problem area and disperse multiple related solutions or strategies, hoping at least one resonates powerfully with their audience. This approach combines breadth with a level of intentionality, ensuring that efforts are relevant and cohesive.

Shotgun entrepreneurs often discover unexpected yet valuable niches or insights through their broader yet targeted exploration. This can effectively bridge the gap between discovery and execution, providing a blend of innovation and practicality.

The risk here is moderate dilution of resources and impact. Without adequate discipline, shotgun entrepreneurs might become entrenched in marginally successful niches, lacking the depth and focus necessary to dominate their chosen field.

## Sniper

The Sniper entrepreneur exemplifies precision, patience, and deep focus. They invest significant time in research, careful planning, and meticulous execution, waiting for the perfect market opportunity or insight before taking action. They deploy resources strategically, often committing wholeheartedly to a well-defined vision.

This approach often yields high-impact, well-executed products or services that clearly differentiate them in the market. Sniper entrepreneurs excel in industries that reward deep expertise, clear differentiation, and quality over quantity.

The major drawback for Sniper entrepreneurs is slower adaptability and the risk of missing out on evolving market opportunities. Excessive deliberation may lead to inertia, and a single miscalculation can have significant consequences due to the limited number of opportunities attempted overall.

## The Archetypes

**Speed and Adaptability:** Gatling Guns are the fastest and most adaptable; Shotguns balance adaptability with intentionality; Snipers are precise but slower to adapt.

**Resource Efficiency:** Snipers are most resource-efficient due to precise targeting; Gatling Guns risk wastefulness; Shotguns fall somewhere between.

**Market Suitability:** Gatling Guns thrive in uncertain, evolving markets; Shotguns suit moderately defined markets with exploratory potential; Snipers excel in stable markets where precision dominates.

Well, entrepreneurs who understand their natural archetype and consciously adopt elements from others when appropriate can significantly enhance their effectiveness.
