# The Pandemic Stress Test

In 2020, the world was thrown into an experiment no startup founder or product manager would have dared to design. The [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) was a global-scale stress test. Every assumption about supply chains, customer behavior, remote work, and team resilience was suddenly put to the test.

## Fragile, Robust, and Anti-Fragile

[Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) popularized the concept of anti-fragility, systems that don’t just resist shocks but improve because of them. A wine glass is fragile: one fall and it’s gone. A steel bar is robust: it withstands stress without changing significantly. A muscle is anti-fragile: it grows stronger when subjected to stress.

The pandemic revealed which products and teams were strong, which were weak, and which were resilient.  

## Products That Broke

Entire categories collapsed almost overnight. Travel apps, event management tools, co-working platforms, and on-premise enterprise software vendors faced existential crises. Fragility was exposed in business models that depended on physical presence, high burn rates, and “growth at all costs” assumptions.  

The harshest lesson: convenience products are the first to vanish when survival instincts kick in. Tools that people thought were “nice to have” evaporated from budgets within weeks.  

## Products That Endured

Then came the robust. Platforms like [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com), [Slack](https://slack.com/), and cloud infrastructure providers became utilities. They didn’t necessarily innovate faster during 2020, but they proved dependable under massive, unplanned loads. Their survival was not due to brilliance alone but because they had built for scalability long before it was tested.

Robustness came from boring engineering: redundancy, distributed systems, and mature processes. The companies that had invested in this were suddenly indispensable.  

## Products That Thrived

And then there were the anti-fragile. Companies like [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.com) accelerated. Shopify’s bet on enabling small merchants online meant the surge in e-commerce was rocket fuel. Notion’s modular, flexible approach to collaboration meant that as teams scrambled to redefine their workflows, the tool adapted to them.  

The stress of the pandemic acted like weights in the gym. The harder the world pulled, the more these products bulked up. They acquired users, and habits, embedding themselves into workflows that will outlast the crisis.  

## Teams as Stress-Tested Systems

Products weren’t the only ones under the microscope. Teams faced the same fragile-robust-anti-fragile sorting.  

- **Fragile teams** cracked under remote work. Culture was overly dependent on physical proximity and unstructured office chatter.  
- **Robust teams** managed to keep the lights on with Zoom calls and project boards.  
- **Anti-fragile teams** re-imagined collaboration. They documented better, created asynchronous rituals, and built trust in new ways. For them, 2020 was a transformation.  

The lesson: anti-fragile teams don’t idolize a single environment. They are fluid. Their cohesion doesn’t weaken when context changes.  

## Lessons for Founders

1. **Build for shocks, not sunshine.** If your product only works in ideal conditions, it’s fragile.  
2. **Invest in process, not perks.** Foosball tables vanish overnight; distributed trust and documentation don’t.  
3. **Look for stress gains.** Where can your product or team actually improve under volatility? That’s anti-fragility.  
4. **Make yourself essential.** Products that became utilities during the pandemic survived. Aim for “cannot function without.”  

## The Long Tail of the Stress Test

The pandemic was not the last shock. Climate events, geopolitical tensions, and economic swings are the future stress tests waiting in the queue. The 2020 experiment revealed a spectrum: fragile systems that broke, robust systems that held, and anti-fragile ones that grew stronger.  

Founders have a choice. You can build wine glasses. You can make steel bars. Or you can build muscles.
