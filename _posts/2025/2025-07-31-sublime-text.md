# Sublime Text

I don’t do much development anymore, and I’m too lazy to learn [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) or [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)). This article is for the archives to remember [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), a beautiful and powerful sturdy companion for a very long time.

I started using it in the same year [it was released](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text), in 2008, and bought my first license in 2009. I have been renewing it since. I’ve tried a few times to replace it, but keep coming back. With Sublime Text, I can open one or many large projects or my entire drive, edit files, and it just works without any of that feeling of drag.

However, I’ve a feeling that I will eventually choose Vim as my retirement IDE.
