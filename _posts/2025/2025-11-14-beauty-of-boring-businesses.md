# The Beauty of Boring Businesses

The startup world loves fireworks. Unicorn valuations, massive rounds, founders on magazine covers. But behind the spotlight live the “boring” businesses that don’t seek fame yet quietly outlive many of the so-called disruptors. They aren’t built for spectacle. They are built for survival, compounding profit, and endurance.  

The irony? These dull, steady enterprises often create more lasting wealth than their flashier cousins.  

## What Makes a Business “Boring”

“Boring” is shorthand for unglamorous. These are industries that don’t get featured in glossy profiles but underpin modern life. [Pest control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_control), [plumbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbing) supply, [packaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging), industrial cleaning, [laundromats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-service_laundry), [HVAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating,_ventilation,_and_air_conditioning) services, or [waste management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management).  

They rarely change much over decades. Their customers keep coming back because the need doesn’t vanish. And their markets are enormous — hidden in plain sight.  
Economists refer to this phenomenon as the [Lindy Effect](/2025/lindy-effect/): the longer a service or product has been in existence, the more likely it is to remain so in the future. People needed clean water centuries ago. They’ll still need it tomorrow.  

## Case Study: Waste Management

In the 1990s, many startups tried to digitize trash collection. Few survived. Yet [Waste Management Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Management,_Inc.), founded in 1968, continued to grow into a Fortune 500 giant with billions in annual revenue. It didn’t need to reinvent the wheel. It simply scaled a boring service with ruthless efficiency.  

Why it works;

- **Recurring demand:** Trash pickup never stops.  
- **Regulatory moats:** Municipal contracts are hard to dislodge.  
- **Steady cash flow:** Predictable revenue and long-term contracts.  

## Case Study: Laundry and Car Washes

Laundromats and car washes don’t trend on Twitter. Yet, they have one of the highest success rates among small businesses. Industry data shows that laundromats average a 95% success rate over five years, while 80% of restaurants fail during the same period.  

Why it works;

- **Low labor:** Often unattended, automated cash machines.  
- **Essential need:** Clean clothes and cars remain non-negotiable.  
- **Cash flow consistency:** Customers return weekly. 

## Cash Flow Beats Valuation

Flashy unicorns chase hypergrowth with investor money. They burn capital, hoping to flip market share into monopoly power. Boring businesses chase cash flow. They grow at their own pace, sustainably, and rarely need to raise rounds.

- [WeWork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeWork), once valued at $47 billion, collapsed spectacularly because it never achieved profitability.  
- [Public Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Storage), founded in 1972, built a simple model — storage lockers. Today, it’s worth over $50 billion with steady profits and dividend payouts.  

One had hype. The other had cash flow. Only one survived.  

## Why Founders Overlook Boring

1. **Status:** No one brags about plumbing supplies at a party.  
2. **Narrative:** Media prefers dramatic failures or world-changing moonshots.  
3. **FOMO:** When unicorns go viral, steady profits feel underwhelming.  

But wealth, independence, and resilience often come from the boring side.  

## Durability During Downturns

During recessions, consumer luxuries shrink. Venture-backed startups implode when funding dries up. Yet, boring companies thrive because demand doesn’t disappear.  

- People still need insurance.  
- They still need their trash picked up.  
- They still pay for storage units, car washes, pest control, and plumbing repairs.  

While unicorns collapse under their burn rate, boring businesses remain stable — sometimes even stronger because they face less competition.  

## The Hidden Power of Compounding

Take a business that earns $500,000 in annual profit. It might look small next to a unicorn with billions in “valuation.” But compounded over 20 years, without investor dilution, that boring business generates $10 million in wealth — and often much more when reinvested.  

Flashy startups rise and fall with market cycles. The boring ones simply compound.  

## The Real “Unicorns”

The true unicorns are not the ones that make headlines but the ones that survive decades. [3M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M), known for [Post-it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_note) notes, began as a boring mining company. [Cintas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cintas), the uniform rental service, quietly scaled into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise. Neither were sexy at the start. Both became indispensable.

The founder’s ego craves excitement, but the market rewards durability. Boring businesses are not dull. They are dependable. They survive recessions, compound profits, and create generational wealth.

Flashy unicorns may rise faster, but boring businesses last longer. That’s the beauty of boring.
