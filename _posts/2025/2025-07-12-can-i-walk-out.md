# Can I Walk Out?

> “Can I walk out with my content?”

Or in the worst-case scenario, “Can I just Walk Out?”, without worrying about the content.

A set of people believes it is always about being open-source versus proprietary software. However, I’d like to question the freedom of how to move my content around, from open-source to proprietary, and from one platform to another.

This was one of my primary reasons for liking and endorsing the likes of [Obsidian](/2025/obsidian/). With Obsidian, there is no cloud lock-in, no required account, and your notes are yours, local and portable. This is freedom. In a time of centralization, this matters. It is a choice to own your thoughts.

Own the content, know your process, and define your patterns. Use tools, leverage the ecosystems, but with [backups](/2021/backup/) so you can “walk out” with minimal nuances.

## POSSE

[POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) or Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere is the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties (like social media silos) with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your content. This approach ensures that even if platforms shut down, censor, or change policies, the creator’s content remains intact and accessible.

## Domain as Digital Identity

Owning your domain name is the foundational step towards this digital independence. A domain serves as a ‘permanent’ address in the online world. It gives you authority and flexibility over your identity, enabling you to use [personalized emails](/2024/email/), such as `hi@yourdomain.com`, reinforcing your brand and professionalism. Beyond just branding, it safeguards your presence from platform lock-in, algorithm changes, and unexpected disruptions.

Personal websites further amplify this control. They allow creators to publish content exactly how they envision it, without restrictions imposed by third-party algorithms, advertisement rules, or format limitations. The layout, design, and structure of a personal website can reflect the creator’s identity, aesthetics, and values, fostering deeper relationships with readers and followers.

Creators can easily archive and manage their content, preserving their digital legacy for future generations.

The [IndieWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWeb) community, which champions these principles, emphasizes interoperability and open standards. IndieWeb tools, such as [Webmentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention), facilitate conversations across platforms while preserving the original context of the discussion on the creator’s site. [Microformats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat) and structured data further enrich content, making it easier to syndicate and aggregate seamlessly.

Platforms like [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social), a decentralized social network built on open protocols, embody this ethos. Mastodon users can host their own instances or join community-run servers, maintaining control over their data while still interacting with broader social networks.

Similarly, [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub), the open social networking protocol behind Mastodon, enables cross-platform interactions, reinforcing user autonomy and content mobility.

While POSSE and IndieWeb principles offer numerous benefits, they necessitate a conscious shift in how we approach online interactions. Users must invest time and effort into learning about hosting services, open protocols, and domain management. However, this investment pays dividends through autonomy, security, and genuine digital freedom.

Well, embracing domain ownership, personal websites, and the POSSE philosophy isn’t merely about technology; it’s about reclaiming autonomy and dignity in the digital age. By taking responsibility for our digital presence, we protect our content, identity, and relationships, ensuring they endure beyond the fleeting life of digital platforms.

Owning your digital identity might seem challenging initially, but it is an empowering journey that secures your presence and influence in an ever-changing online world.
