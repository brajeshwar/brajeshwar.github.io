# Digital Chores

We don’t want dirty dishes to stay in the sink for days, nor do we keep dirty clothes piled for weeks, yet we often treat our phones and laptops that way. Unattended emails, forgotten files, stale software, and unchecked notifications build up until productivity slows and security buckles. Regular digital chores keep your tech life tidy, safe, and fast, without the last‑minute panic clean‑up.

Alright, this may not work precisely the way one wishes. However, I hope this serves as a starting point or inspiration to define your own style, process, and patterns for an organized digital life.

## Weekly

- **[Email Inbox Triage.](/2024/email/)** Archive or delete emails, answer the quick ones, and flag the rest so your eyes do not glaze over the next morning.
- **Empty Downloads and Trash.** Anything you needed is now filed; the rest is clutter. Alternatively, automate the process to archive, sort, or trash items after a specified period.
- **[Sync and/or Backup.](/2021/backup/)** Use either a cloud service or an external drive, whichever is faster or suits you. A tiny push each week saves heartbreak later.
- **Update Operating System and Apps.** Security fixes arrive constantly. Install or upgrade them regularly, or consider automating the process.
- **Review [Notes](/2025/notes/) and To‑Do Lists.** Close what is done, reorder the rest, and start the week with purpose.

## Monthly

- **Organize Files And Folders.** Move finished work to a project archive and label it clearly. I like the PARA method of organization.
- **Organize your Pictures & Videos.** Delete duplicates and fuzzy shots, export a backup copy from Apple Photos, etc.
- **Review/Cancel Subscriptions and Licenses.** Stop paying for tools you forgot existed.
- **Working Backups.** Capture snapshots you can restore from if disaster strikes. Make sure your [Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)) is working, or you have something like [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Copy_Cloner) or [Duplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicity_(software)) doing its job.
- **Delete unused apps.** If you haven’t used an app in a couple of months, free up the space.

## Quarterly

- **[Security & Privacy Audit.](/2025/onion/)** Double‑check two‑factor settings, recovery emails, and security questions.
- **Firmware Updates.** Routers, smart speakers, and anything that can connect to the Internet needs to be taken care of.
- **Archive Completed Projects.** Offload or backup to cold storage so active drives stay lean.
- **Social Media Spring‑Clean.** Prune followers, tighten privacy, and un‑tag ancient photos.
- **Health Check on Hardware.** Inspect battery cycles, disk health, and spare capacity.

## Annually

- **Off‑site Backup Test and Refresh.** A [backup](/2021/backup/) is only real if you can restore it. Test them at least once a year.
- **Account Consolidation.** Close dormant logins and merge duplicate services to reduce the attack surface.
- **Deep Clean Physical Gears.** Dust fans, swap thermal paste, and replace crusty cables.
- **Review and Upgrade Storage Media.** Hard drives age; SSD prices drop. Plan migrations before failure.
- **Label and Store the Year’s Memories.** Photos, tax documents, and creative work deserve neat folders and clear names.

Small, regular sweeps keep data in motion and problems visible. Skip a few weeks, and chores pile up like laundry after finals. Skip a year and you face lost files, security breaches, or a painfully slow machine.

Set calendar reminders, automate what you can, and treat digital chores as part of everyday life. Your future self, team, and devices will stay lighter, faster, and ready for whatever comes next.
