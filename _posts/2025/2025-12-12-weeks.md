# StumbleUpon this Week

I have been collecting interesting bookmarks for a while now. I had no idea how to deal with it. While I dated back to the [1st week of 2025](/2025/week1/), the first weekly post started on the [26th Week of 2025](/2025/week26/).

`Target: To publish the weeklies every Saturdays.`

The most ideal way would have been to treat them as Jekyll’s [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/). However, I want the simplicity of decoupling it from anything, and it should be able to exist on its own. Jekyll still converts it to HTML, like all the other posts, but it should be able to stand on its own as plain text (Markdown) that can be converted to HTML by any tool in the future, or I will simply write in plain HTML.

The idea is to make it part of the regular articles or posts and accessible via the [URL pattern](/2025/cool-uris-dont-change/) of `/YYYY/weekxx/`.

Of course, there will be weeks I won’t be able to publish and that is OK. I will see what I StumbleUpon on my journey ahead.
