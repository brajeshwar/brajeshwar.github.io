[VSScan](https://vscan.dev) proactively analyze [Visual Studio Code extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) for security vulnerabilities and ensure a safer development environment. VSCode extensions run with full access to your system, including file system, network, and credentials. Well, malicious extensions have already made it into the marketplace, and are silently compromising devices.

VSScan is a free tool that scans VSCode (and Cursor/Windsurf) extensions for;

- Hidden malware and obfuscated code
- Dangerous permissions and API misuse
- Vulnerable dependencies and suspicious network connections

[FilMaster](https://filmaster-ai.github.io/) is bridging cinematic principles and generative ai for automated film generation. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18899)

FilMaster apply cinematic principles in camera language design, cinematic rhythm control to create high-quality films, including a rich, dynamic audio landscape. They automates the entire process, from script analysis to final render, and delivers project files compatible with professional editing software.

[UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is an “extremely fast” Python package and project manager, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). It tries to be that one tool to replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, etc.
