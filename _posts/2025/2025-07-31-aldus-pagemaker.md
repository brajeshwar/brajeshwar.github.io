# Aldus PageMaker (1985-2004)

Another Software that made my career, became part of my professional life, and paid for my high school and college tuition fees, among other things. Working in Aldus PageMaker (and CorelDRAW[^CorelDRAW]) gave me the feeling of playing with the big boys that I had after graduating from typing content in [WordStar](/2024/wordstar/) for the professionals.

[Aldus PageMaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus_PageMaker) (bought by Adobe in 1995) was a desktop publishing computer program introduced in 1985 by the Aldus Corporation on the Apple Macintosh. The combination of the Macintoshâ€™s graphical user interface, PageMaker publishing software, and the Apple LaserWriter laser printer marked the beginning of the desktop publishing revolution. Ported to PCs running Windows 1.0 in 1987, PageMaker helped to popularize both the Macintosh platform and the Windows environment.

Thank You, Aldus PageMaker.
