# Monaco

If you have ever written code on a Mac, odds are, you’ve met Monaco. In a world pampered with choices of programming typefaces, Monaco quietly reminds us that sometimes less is a lot more. 

[Monaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_(typeface)), designed by [Susan Kare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare), [Kris Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Holmes), and [Charles Bigelow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bigelow_(type_designer)) way back in the mid-1980s, was not created to be trendy. In fact, one could argue that Monaco is the antithesis of the trend. It is simple, monospaced, and gloriously devoid of ornament.

Monaco is everywhere (on [Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)), at least). Opening up Terminal? Hello, Monaco. Tweaking some script in an early Xcode? Ah, Monaco again. You do not need to jump through hoops, dig into font repositories, or curse your IT department. 

Monaco is likely there, pre-installed, ready to roll. No installation ritual, no tedious configuration. It’s as if the developers at Apple knew we didn’t want “font FOMO”.[^FOMO] Monaco is the warm, nondescript blanket we can always reach for. 

The font’s designers clearly had us, caffeine-fueled and sleep-deprived developers, in mind. Every character is distinct. The lowercase `“l”` and number `“1”`? No confusion. A zero with a neat dot, not to be confused with the letter `“O”`. Monaco basically says, “Don’t worry, I won’t let you mistake your variables again!”

To a developer, Monaco is like that reliable friend who may not win a beauty contest but always shows up with coffee, code, and consistency.

Well, coding is not easy without fonts sabotaging you. Monaco’s crisp, regular design ensures your `“;”` (semicolon) and `“:”` (colon) are no longer codebreakers. Its balanced spacing and unremarkable elegance put code front and center - no distractions, no embellishments, no designer showing off. This clarity is particularly essential when skimming thousands of lines, pair-coding over a screen share, or debugging at 3 in the morning.

Monaco’s enduring appeal lies in its understated nature. It fades into the background, allowing you to focus on the business of building, breaking, and fixing. There may be “cooler” choices, fonts that ligature your arrows into harpoons, or ones that look like a space opera. But Monaco is always there, quietly powering your productivity and maybe, just maybe, judging you a little less than Comic Sans would.

[^FOMO]: [Fear of missing out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) (FOMO) is the feeling of apprehension that one is either not in the know about or missing out on information, events, experiences, or life decisions that could make one’s life better.
