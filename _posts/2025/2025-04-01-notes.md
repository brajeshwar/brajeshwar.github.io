# Notes

1. **Pocket (A7) & Apple Notes** is usually the starting entry point of my notes, which are mostly temporary, rough, and ephemeral notes. Some of them, though optional, tend to get transferred to the Journal or the [Commonplace](/2024/commonplace-book/).
2. **Journal (A5)** in a physical notebook. I have also started writing a recollection of my life’s story, like a memoir, in [plain-text](/2022/plain-text/).
3. **Commonplace (A5)** is a knowledge base in a physical notebook and digital plain text written in Markdown.
4. **Kids (A5)** is a unique physical notebook for my daughters. I write stories about them, and for them to read.

As of **2025-April**, my physical notebooks is the [Midori MD Paper](/2024/midori/) and digital plain-text is managed by [Obsidian](/2025/obsidian/). I’ve decided to simplify the physical notebooks to two [standard paper sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size) - A5 and A7.
