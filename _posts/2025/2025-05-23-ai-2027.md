# AI 2027

> We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution.

[AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) is a detailed forecast scenario predicting rapid progress in the automation of coding and AI research, followed by AGI. It predicts that fully autonomous AI agents will be better than humans at “everything” around the end of 2027.

AI 2027 released their first forecasts on April 3, 2025. AI 2027 is run by the [AI Futures Project](https://ai-futures.org).

This is an interesting read and very clear depiction of the near future of [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI) and eventually [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) (AGI). Time will tell us how this goes.
