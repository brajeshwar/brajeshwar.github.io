# AI 2027

[AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) is a detailed forecast scenario predicting rapid progress in the automation of coding and AI research, followed by AGI. It predicts that fully autonomous AI agents will be better than humans at “everything” around the end of 2027.

We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution.

AI 2027 released its first forecasts on April 3, 2025. AI 2027 is run by the [AI Futures Project](https://ai-futures.org).

In brief, it outlines two possible outcomes, “slowdown” or “race,” starting this year, 2025. By early 2026, we might see AI-driven R&D automation boosting algorithmic progress by over 50%, showcasing AI’s potential to transform scientific discovery.

This is an interesting read. It offers a vivid, quantitative narrative that moves beyond vague forecasts to detailed computing and alignment milestones, a relatively clear depiction of the near future of Artificial Intelligence (AI),[^AI] and eventually, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).[^AGI]

[^AI]: [Artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.

[^AGI]: [Artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) (AGI), sometimes called human‑level intelligence AI—is a type of artificial intelligence that would match or surpass human capabilities across virtually all cognitive tasks. Some researchers argue that state‑of‑the‑art large language models already exhibit early signs of AGI‑level capability, while others maintain that genuine AGI has not yet been achieved. AGI is conceptually distinct from [artificial superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_superintelligence) (ASI), which would outperform the best human abilities across every domain by a wide margin. AGI is considered one of the definitions of strong AI.
