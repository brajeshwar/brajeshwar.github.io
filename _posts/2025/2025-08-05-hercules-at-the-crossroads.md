# Hercules at the Crossroads

Even though the story is fictitious, it resonated with me. I like [The Road Not Taken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken).

Once upon a time, in the life of Hercules, he came to the crossroads. The road diverged, and a beautiful goddess lay there who offered him every temptation he could imagine. Adorned in finery, she promised him a life of ease. She swore heâ€™d never taste want or unhappiness or fear or pain. Follow her, she said, and his every desire would be fulfilled.

On the other path stood a sterner goddess in a pure white robe. She made a quieter call. She promised no rewards except those that came as a result of hard work. It would be a long journey, she said. There would be a sacrifice. There would be scary moments. But it was a journey fit for the god. It would make him the person his ancestors meant him to be.
