# Flash, Java Applets, and Building for a Web That Died

The late 1990s and early 2000s felt like a carnival of possibility. The Web was young, browsers were crude, and the only way to make something look alive was to hack together technologies that bent, sometimes broke, the limits of HTML. For a generation of builders, [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and [Java Applets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet) were the weapons of choice.  

[I lived through the Flash years.](/2005/brajeshwar-on-flash-8-credit-roll/) Not as a passive observer, but as one of the many who poured sweat into ActionScript code, shaped pixels into interactive experiences, and felt the strange thrill of watching a blank browser window light up with animation and sound. It was the era of “Skip Intro”[^SkipIntro] buttons, vector graphics dancing to MP3 loops, and websites that felt more like games than documents.  

Looking back now, it’s hard not to feel a sense of nostalgia. Flash is gone, Applets are forgotten, and the Web that once promised infinite creativity is now corralled into frameworks, compliance checklists, and app-store rules. But the lessons from building on those extinct platforms still matter, especially for product builders riding today’s waves of hype.

## Flash: The Web’s Playground

Flash started as a lightweight tool for vector animations but quickly evolved into something bigger: an entire platform within the browser. By the time Macromedia released Flash 4 and then Flash MX, it wasn’t just about animations. You could build video players, games, and entire applications. For a brief moment, Flash was the Web.  

I remember late nights hunched over ActionScript 1.0, piecing together movie clips like they were Lego bricks. Debugging meant endless console traces and praying you hadn’t broken the timeline. Yet, it was fun. Fun in a way that modern dev stacks rarely are. You could sketch, prototype, and publish in hours.  

As [Jonathan Gay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Gay), one of Flash’s creators, once said, “We wanted people to be able to create interactive content as easily as they could draw a picture.” Flash fulfilled that vision. It gave designers superpowers, even if they didn’t know how to code.  

And then there was the community. Sites like [FlashKit](https://flashkit.com/) and [Newgrounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrounds) were buzzing hives of creativity. Someone would post a particle effect tutorial, and within days, dozens of clones would appear, tweaked and improved. It felt like open-source without GitHub. It was messy, chaotic, and beautiful.  

## The Rise of Applets

[Java Applets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet) promised something Flash couldn’t: real programming. They ran compiled Java code in the browser, giving developers access to more power than HTML or JavaScript ever allowed at the time. You could spin up simulations, calculators, even early games. Universities loved them because you could run physics experiments or use graphing tools without installing software.  

But Applets always felt heavy. The gray box would load, the little steaming coffee cup icon would appear, and you would wait. And wait. And wait.  

Still, in their own awkward way, Applets pointed to a future where the browser could be a runtime for real software. They were clunky, insecure, and plagued by performance issues, but they laid the groundwork for what would later become modern web applications.  

## The Sands of Time

The trouble with both Flash and Applets was simple: they were built on the [sands of time](/2025/internet-ephemerality/). Neither were truly “of the web.” They were plugins, proprietary runtimes, sandboxes within sandboxes.  

When Steve Jobs wrote [Thoughts on Flash](https://web.archive.org/web/20100501010616/https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/) in 2010, he killed Flash with a blog post. iPhones and iPads would never support it. Overnight, what had once been the darling of creative developers became toxic. By 2020, [Adobe officially ended support](https://web.archive.org/web/20200102214130/https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-flash-update/) for Flash.  

Java Applets had already died a slower, quieter death. Browsers’ deprecated support. Security researchers shredded them with exploits. By the mid-2010s, they were relics of the past.  

The lesson here is brutal but clear: if you build on a platform that isn’t truly open, you’re at the mercy of someone else’s roadmap. The same lesson echoes today, as startups often depend entirely on app stores, closed APIs, or social platforms.  

## The Fun We Had

But oh, the fun we had before the fall.  

One of my fondest memories was building tiny Flash games that spread faster than I ever expected. This was before viral loops became product strategy jargon. A silly animation or quirky interaction could go viral simply because it delighted people.

I still remember the sound libraries, the stock “click,” the cartoon “boing,” the endless supply of swooshes and beeps. You could drag them into your timeline and instantly make something playful.  

There was joy in not knowing where it would all lead. In one corner of the Web, artists were making experimental films in Flash. In another instance, agencies were crafting “interactive brand experiences” that resembled video games. Some of it was ridiculous, much of it impractical, but it was ours.  

## From Toys to Tools

Today, the spirit of Flash lives on in frameworks like [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and [Unity](https://unity.com/), which export to [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). The browser has matured. JavaScript engines are faster, and you can perform tasks in native code that once required a plugin. But the vibe is different.

Developers now worry about accessibility, compliance, SEO, and cross-device testing. All good and necessary. Yet sometimes I wonder what we lost when we traded spontaneity for structure.  

Back then, nobody cared if your Flash site was indexable by Google. You just wanted it to look cool. You wanted it to feel alive.  

So what does this mean for product builders in 2025, when the hype cycle has shifted to AI, AR, VR, Web3, and Blockchain platforms?  

1. **Beware of closed ecosystems.** Flash developers were kings until Apple snapped its fingers. If your startup depends entirely on one vendor’s blessing, you’re building on sand.
2. **Play before you optimize.** The wild experimentation of Flash gave birth to ideas we take for granted now: streaming video players, browser games, and dynamic interfaces. Play leads to breakthroughs. 
3. **Every platform dies.** Java Applets are gone. Flash is gone. Even Facebook apps have vanished. Whatever platform feels eternal today, whether it’s Twitter or OpenAI APIs,  will eventually fade. Don’t mistake distribution for permanence.
4. **What endures is community.** The Flash community outlived Flash itself. Many of its veterans now shape games, animation, and creative coding elsewhere. Tools come and go, but networks of people carry the knowledge forward.  

When Adobe officially announced the end of Flash, I felt that wave of nostalgia, “an era had come to a close.” The tools I once knew like the back of my hand were now artifacts, archived on GitHub or remembered in YouTube demos.  

But I also realized something: building on a dying platform is not wasted effort. The skills endure. The creative confidence, the willingness to tinker, the ability to ship fast and ugly, all of that carried into the rest of my career.  

The Web that Flash and Applets promised is dead. But the spirit of building things that delight, that surprise, that make people smile, that spirit is still alive if we choose to carry it.  

Flash may be gone, but invention never dies. 


[^SkipIntro]: “Skip Intro” was the hallmark of early Flash websites. Designers loved flashy animated splash screens, often with music, logos flying in, or cinematic sequences before the actual site appeared. Users, impatient to get to the content, were offered a tiny “Skip Intro” button—half joke, half necessity. It became both a design cliché and a symbol of an era when style often trumped usability.
