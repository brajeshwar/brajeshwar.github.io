# Touch Typing

[Touch Typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing) is the ability to type without looking at your keyboard. It involves using muscle memory to find keys, allowing you to focus your eyes and mind entirely on the screen. Imagine being able to type as naturally as breathing; thatâ€™s the beauty of touch typing.

More than speed, the benefits of touch typing are accuracy, quality, and the health of your hands. It also helps to maintain better, more ergonomic posture.
