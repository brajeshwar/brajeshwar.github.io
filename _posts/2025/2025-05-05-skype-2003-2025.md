[Skype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype) (2003-2025) was the one tool that propelled my career, allowing me to work remotely for companies in the USA since the early 2000s. My primary communication was emails and a bit of [Windows Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Messenger). While I worked with Joey Lott, the author of [ActionScript Cookbook](https://archive.org/details/actionscriptcook00lott), he [introduced me to Skype](https://brajeshwar.com/2004/skype-this-is-cool/).

Skype became one of my must-have tools. It became a lifeline while working with clients from the opposite side of the globe.

On 10 May 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype for $8.5 billion. [Microsft retired Skype](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/skype-is-retiring-in-may-2025-what-you-need-to-know-2a7d2501-427f-485e-8be0-2068a9f90472) on May 5, 2025.

Thank You, Skype. You served me and my teams well.
