# Internet Ephemerality

Nothing lasts forever. A few do, however, last for a long time, the best being a few decades, especially in the digital world.

I’ve been on the Internet for 25+ years. I’ve witnessed firsthand how software, apps, and online services appear, thrive, and eventually vanish. It’s a reminder of digital life’s transient nature, where services we trust deeply today may become obsolete or shut down tomorrow.

Take Google Reader,[^GoogleReader] for instance. Launched in 2005, it quickly became the gold standard for RSS feeds, used by millions, including myself. When Google decided to pull the plug in 2013, it felt like losing a trusted companion. Users scrambled to export years of carefully curated feeds. Many shifted to alternatives like [Feedly](https://feedly.com), [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com), [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com), [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com), or [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com), but the abrupt end taught us a crucial lesson: never rely entirely on one service.

Another poignant example is GeoCities.[^GeoCities] It was the first place where many of us built our initial web presence. At its peak, GeoCities hosted millions of personal websites, each a unique expression of digital creativity. But by 2009, Yahoo shut down GeoCities, erasing an enormous part of Internet history overnight. The tragedy wasn’t merely in its closure but in the loss of countless web pages that people hadn’t backed up or moved elsewhere.

Evernote was once an [App to remember everything](/2011/evernote-remember-everything/). More recently, consider Evernote’s dramatic shift. A beloved productivity app for note-taking, it began tightening limits and restructuring its pricing. Users who’d built elaborate systems around it faced tough decisions. While [Evernote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evernote) hasn’t shut down, it reminded users about the risks of heavily depending on proprietary systems that control your data.

What I’ve learned through these experiences is simple yet profound: [always maintain control over your content and data](/2025/can-i-walk-out/). It isn’t about rejecting online services or apps altogether, but about ensuring you have the flexibility to pivot smoothly when necessary. [Regularly backing up data](/2021/backup/), using interoperable formats, and preferring tools that allow easy migration are strategies that safeguard your digital life.

As ephemeral[^ephemerality] as these services may be, our digital presence doesn’t have to vanish with them. Understanding this helps us embrace change, ensuring we remain nimble and prepared for the inevitable shifts of the online world.


[^GoogleReader]: [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader) was an RSS/Atom feed aggregator operated by Google. It was created in early 2005 by Google engineer [Chris Wetherell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wetherell) and launched on October 7, 2005, through Google Labs. Google Reader grew in popularity to support a number of programs which used it as a platform for serving news and information to users. Google closed Google Reader on July 1, 2013.

[^GeoCities]: GeoCities, was a web hosting service that allowed users to create and publish websites for free and to browse user-created websites by their theme or interest, active from 1994 to 2009. GeoCities was started in November 1994 by David Bohnett and John Rezner, and was named Beverly Hills Internet briefly before being renamed GeoCities. On January 28, 1999, it was acquired by Yahoo!, at which time it was reportedly the third-most visited website on the [World Wide Web](/2021/world-wide-web-30-years/).

[^ephemerality]: [Ephemerality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemerality) is the concept of things being transitory, existing only briefly. Academically, the term ephemeral constitutionally describes a diverse assortment of things and experiences, from digital media to types of streams. Because different people may value the passage of time differently, ephemerality may be a relative, perceptual concept: “In brief, what is short-lived may not be the object itself, but the attention we afford it.”
