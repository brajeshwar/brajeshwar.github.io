<p>Design Leaders aren't super-designers. Their role is NOT to 'approve or disapprove' other designers. Nor is it to dot the final pixel-perfect or sweat the final details to a design.</p>
<p>Many organizations make the common mistake of confusing design managers with design leaders. Design leaders touch upon the organization, and not just the design department. The role is strategic and needs to align with the organization's strategy and plans.</p>
<h2>C-suite Design Leaders who can take decisions</h2>
<p>Organizations, in search for a competitive advantage over their counterparts, should have more visible acts of advocacy for design leadership. Hiring design leaders such as "Chief Design Officer" or similar C-suite Vice President design roles is a good start.</p>
<p>A successful design leader brings in a design harmony, patterns, frameworks, and guides across the organization. From the very deep core of visual and experience designs to brand messaging to treating people, a design leader has a meaningful impact. She can have a successful and meaningfully designed product, by working with the team, without herself ever opening Photoshop or Sketch. She might just be sketching on a napkin but she connects the dots and get the team to execute the best of designs.</p>
<h2>Erstwhile Craftsman & Practitioner</h2>
<p>One key measure of a successful design leader is her effective presentation skills. She should be able to talk with confidence and drive everyone involved towards a common goal. She should have good management skills and leverage the best of design managers. Finally, she should mentor and help more designers become leaders.</p>
<blockquote class="alignleft"><p>Marcin Treder <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/persona-great-design-leader/">said it beautifully</a>, "Great design leaders are seasoned practitioners, ready to give up the craft."</p></blockquote>
<p>A design leader leads and drives discussions with the design team, management and beyond. She initiates dialogue, both good and bad, to achieve the common goal of producing good meaningful designs. She instills an inquisitive mood of asking "what" driving organizations to produce better-designed products. She is confident in leaving the "how" of designs to the designers and the team.</p>
<h2>The Right Person</h2>
<p>It is sad but many organizations try to bring in design leaders who are not designers but carved out of seasoned managers. Without design leaders, organizations cannot achieve good designs. Without a design leader, even the best designers will just be answering to the whims of managers to fulfill client and customer demands that might not be good in the long term.</p>
<p>A design leader continues to be actively involved in design disciplines, remain driven to design, coaches others, is a team player, always open-minded, is not afraid of change, and is always ready to give actionable feedback. Last, but not the least, a design leader is committed to integrating design and design thinking throughout the organization.</p>
<p>"Design leaders succeed by designing indirectly – through the work of their teams. The key task of a design leader is to become the worst designer on the team." -- <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/persona-great-design-leader/">Marcin Treder</a></p>
