# Books of 2026

> `2026:` Work-in-Progress

## Recommendations

1. I expected [Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World](/2019/genghis-khan-and-the-making-of-the-modern-world/) to be a history-ish book but turns out to be about change, and a progressive advance into a better future. No, Genghis Khan was definitely not a good person. The book is not about that. The book is about meritocratic leadership, equal opportunity, efficiency, religious tolerance, etc.
2. [Ego is the Enemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_Is_the_Enemy) is a book of stories and examples. It reminds us of the stories of the likes of Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt – they all reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos.
3. [How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World](/2024/how-we-got-to-now/) by Steven Johnson is about how six important inventions shaped the world to today. Small ideas have big effects, and that many of the things we use every day came about in surprising and unexpected ways. The book details the history of the six key innovations—**Glass, Cold, Sound, Clean, Time, and Light.**

[Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus:_A_Brief_History_of_Information_Networks_from_the_Stone_Age_to_AI) by Yuval Noah Harari is a familiar read if you have read his prior works such as [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind), [Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow), or [21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Lessons_for_the_21st_Century). You will go through the provocative claim, historical anecdote, philosophical zoom-out, mild warning, and the whole shebangs. I found myself doing my quick speed-reading at many pages of the book. My interest was, of course, the section on AI. The book frames AI as the information network that can generate, modify, and act on information without human understanding or consent at scale; something categorically different.
