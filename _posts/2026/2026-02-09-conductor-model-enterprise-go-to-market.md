# The Conductor’s Model for Enterprise Go-To-Market

[Go-to-Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-to-market_strategy) (GTM) mishaps are often coordination failures rather than execution failures. Every smart person in the team works at their best; marketing is busy, sales are active, product is shipping, the internal dashboards are lit, and the gong is often hit with the loudest sound. Unfortunately, when things settle, the layers peel, and the hard questions are asked; the results are rather unimpressive and lackluster.

Enterprise GTM is more like an orchestra. Many instruments. Different tempos. High cost of mistakes. Someone has to decide what plays when. Someone has to stop the noise.

Effort has never been the problem. Perhaps then, it is a coordinated orchestration that is lacking.

Imagine a [Conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting) of an Orchestra who generally knows what every specialist musician is playing and will play.

## When Execution Gets Cheap, Judgment Gets Expensive

It has never been easier to produce output. Research, content, analysis, follow-ups, forecasts. Pretty much all of them are much easier now.

What remains hard are decisions.

- Which account actually matters?
- Which conversation should happen now?
- Which stakeholder should not be involved yet?
- Which initiative should be paused, even if it looks promising?
- Which paying customers are draining the team’s energy and might not be worth the money?

These decisions slow teams down because they require context, taste, and accountability. No system can make them for you. At best, systems amplify the quality of the call already made. In enterprise GTM, judgment is the bottleneck.

## Orchestration over Optimization

Most GTM teams try to optimize locally. Better messaging. Better demos. Better funnels. However, time and again, enterprises have proven that they respond more to coherence, consistency, and predictability.

- Sales push before risk is addressed, then deals slow down.
- Marketing frames value before procurement is ready, credibility drops.
- Product promises land before legal alignment, trust suffers.

Orchestration is about order. What goes first, what should wait, and which ones should stay quiet? Batch or sequence the actions to make it smoother to win deals. I have seen experienced operators who know when to accelerate and when to hold. Inexperienced ones are just all over the place, confusing speed with progress.

For instance, in a rather simplified version, Interest precedes evaluation. Evaluation precedes risk review. Risk review precedes procurement. Procurement precedes signature.

## Owning the Distribution Channels

Most enterprise buying is, by default, a result of inheritance. They adopt the mundane, boring tools and services that worked through their existing vendors, internal champions, and relationships built long before a sales call. This is why large platforms can launch new offerings with little marketing and still win.

One of the big learnings during my tenure at [Razorfish](https://www.razorfish.com) was, “Who owns the Distribution Channels?” Hence, what are the budgets for time, money, and teams’ effort across Owned, Earned, and Paid Channels?

For everyone else, GTM is about proximity to trusted paths. This translates to, unfortunately, fewer channels, fewer messages, fewer promises, but with more proof, trust, and more intention. The focus is on accessing and empathizing with your customers for their customers.

## Precision and Seriousness Signalling

In enterprise settings, the tone matters more than polish. They will notice how measured your claims are, how you react when something breaks, how you treat your competitors, and even whether you say NO or just say “Yes” bluntly to everything.

They are trying to reduce perceived risk, which leads to speedy decisions. Well, now we know why some of the most boring solutions often get adopted first. They are safe, and their effects compound over time.

## Human in the Loop

I learned the hard way that enterprises are a lot more personal than the typical consumer. Someone with authority stands behind the work. Someone is accountable when things go wrong. It impacts their next promotion, their pride in the next board meetings, and the stories they tell in their family gatherings.

As organizations grow, this responsibility gets distributed, they never goes away. Enterprise GTM always has a human core. Be the Human in all of the machinery around, be it AI, automation, or workflows.

## Do the Extra Work but Be Quiet

One of the most important works in enterprise GTM rarely shows up in reports. It happens in pre-meetings, alignment calls, early emails, and, well, the casual settings at the Golf Courses. Do the extracurricular activities, the homework, and [make it look effortless](/2026/sprezzatura/) when the meetings happen.

## The Conductor’s Role

The conductor does not play every instrument. They listen. They decide. They intervene sparingly. They control tempo. They enforce order. They protect coherence. In enterprise GTM, this is the key advantage.

Tools are becoming ever more powerful. A well-coordinated set of tools can avoid noise, friction, and chaos.

Enterprise Go-to-Market has become louder, faster, noisier, and chaotic. The most deliberate ones are the ones winning, sequencing carefully, respecting risk, and managing distribution.

They are dead serious, precise, and they conduct. I’m in awe of seeing some of the best founders and GTM leaders, and the ones who work are like a well-oiled machine.
