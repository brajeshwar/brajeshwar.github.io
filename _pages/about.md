title: About Brajeshwar
---

Hi, my name is Brajeshwar Oinam.

I was born in a quiet and serene, hill-surrounded green valley of [Imphal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imphal), Manipur (INDIA), and spent all my childhood-school-life, teenage-college-life there.

The domain `brajeshwar.com` was [registered on Jun 11, 2001](/about/brajeshwar.com/).

## Work

I landed in [Bombay](/2009/bombay/) on Aug 2, 1999 to kick-start my career. I soon fell in love with the city, the speed, and the pace at which things get done.

After job-hunting for a month, I landed my first job as a Computer Graphic Designer in a Comic Magazine Startup. As part of the test for the job, they gave me a [floppy disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk) which contains the files to complete a graphic editing task. In those early days, I was crashing at the Mumbai University Hostel and had no access to a computer. I went about an hour early for the Interview and finished the job at an [Internet café](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_café) nearby. Well, they were impressed with the task and my story on how I completed it. I started work the following week.

## Internet

It was the Internet boom in India, and the proliferation of the Internet was prominent. I wanted to be part of that world. Within six months through my first job, I shifted my focus to the Online World - started reading lots of books, online resources, and there was no turning back. By mid-2000, I had shifted my focus to the Internet.

## Startups

In early 2003, I resigned from a very lucrative job and started freelancing full-time. During those freelance days, I did many exciting work and enjoyed every moment of it. I learned a lot from those experiences, made many friends, and hitch some of the most rewarding relationships.

By 2005, I decided to take the plunge and started our first company - Oinam Software. We undertook some of the most innovative, sometimes very experimental work for clients, such as
[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com),
[Cambridge University Entrepreneurs](http://www.cue.org.uk/),
[Disney](http://disney.com/),
[Macromedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia),
[Obeo](http://obeo.com/),
[Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/us/),
[STARZ](http://www.starz.com/),
[Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com),
*et al*.

We also worked for many contractors who sub-contracted their work to us. We were, in fact, one of the best ghost developers to many successful contractors.

In 2006, [Mixercast, Inc](https://www.linkedin.com/company/167518) acquired the Oinam Team. It was an exciting experience, being part of a Startup and learning from it. Unfortunately, [Mixercast](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/mixercast) was dissolved on Dec 31, 2009 after selling its IP (Intellectual Property) to erstwhile Google (now Alphabet).

In 2007, I started [oCricket](/2023/ocricket/), a dedicated network for Cricket lovers and fans. We envisioned oCricket to be able to get users to access Cricket related media and content more efficiently and at a much affordable price. oCricket was acquired by Infinitely Beta Pvt. Ltd. in June 2009.

The team of oCricket went on to become the initial team of Infinitely Beta. It’s flagship product, Paisa.com, was praised by industry experts and beta testers for its innovative User Interface and a never-before-done-in-India User Experience. Paisa.com was merged in February 2012 with HelpShift which has raised venture capital from Nexus Ventures, True Ventures, and others.

In 2010, I started Levoma, a mobile video-dating service, helping singles aged 18-30, find partners easily, quickly, and effectively. We were the first Indian startup to graduate at the [Founder Institute in 2010-2011](/2011/the-founder-institute-experience/) Winter Silicon Valley Chapter. Levoma was among the final 12 graduating companies out of it’s initial cohort of 50+ startups. Levoma released its beta App in January 2011. It was acquired by a Singapore Investment firm - Kamelot Kapital Pte Ltd.

Between 2014 to 2016, I worked at [Razorfish](https://www.razorfish.com) as a Creative Director. I led the creative design and development at Razorfish, Bangalore, India. In a year, I hired and trained 50+ proficient designers and developers. I trained them and taught best practices, standards of design, and development.

I helped build Aditya Birla’s ABOF.com, Johnson & Johnson Visioncare, and DMart’s eCommerce Initiative in India. I Worked with Razorfish, UK on careers.jpmorgan.com, and with Razorfish, Austin on Car2Go. I was lucky to mentor, review code and designs for
MyDeposits (UK),
Phaladata (USA),
Zest Money (India).

In 2018, I met my co-founder, Gurjot Singh, while he was experimenting with the idea of large-scale energy storage with Vanadium Redox Batteries. He is a research scientist who specializes in the study of energy, food, and fuel. Unfortunately, due to the high CAPEX requirements, we pivoted to Smart, and Precision farming with Aeroponics. We built a demo farm in Bangalore, India. We were invited, and interviewed at Mountain View but got rejected for the Y Combinator Winter 2019 Batch. Gurjot moved on to a second generation Bio-fuel generation technique backed by the Swish government, and a private Swish technology company. I stayed behind to find solutions to the myriad of problems of Climate Changes.

Between 2018 and 2019, I consulted with [Mobisy](https://mobisy.com) as the Chief Product Officer. Mobisy is a high-growth, technology company that is transforming the retail supply ecosystems in several markets, including India, Africa, Middle East, and Europe through its products Bizom and Distiman.

Mobisy’s products serve over 300 top consumer brands, including global FMCG giants such as Cargill, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt-Benckiser, Coke, Pepsi, Mondelez, and Hershey’s. As of 2019, Mobisy’s products have over 150,000 users and reach 5 million retailers.

Since 2021, I’ve been experimenting, and building beautiful and meaningful products focusing on Geospatial Data producing solutions for Climate Change.
