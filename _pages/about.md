I was born in a quiet and serene, hill-surrounded green valley of [Imphal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imphal), Manipur (INDIA) and spent all my childhood-school-life, teenage-college-life there.

## Professional Career

I migrated to [Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay) in 1999 to kick-start my professional career. Very soon I fell in love with the city, the speed, and the pace at which things get done.

After job-hunting for a month, I landed my first job as a Computer Graphic Designer in a Comic Magazine Startup. As part of the test for the job, I was given a [Floppy-Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk) which contains the files to complete a graphic editing task. Without a computer at home, I went about an hour early for the Interview and finished the task at a 'cyber-cafe' nearby. Well, they were impressed with the task and my story on how I completed it. I started work the next week.

## Internet

It was the Internet boom in India and the proliferation of the Internet was seen prominently. I really wanted to be part of that world. Within 6 months through my first job, I shifted my focus to the Online World - started reading lots of books, online resources and there was no turning back. By mid-2000, I had totally shifted my focus on to the Internet.

## Startup

In early 2003, I resigned from a very lucrative job and started freelancing full-time. During those freelance days, I did a lot of interesting work and totally enjoyed every moment of it. I learned a lot from those experiences, made lots of friends, and hitch some of the most rewarding relationships.

By 2005, I decided it was time to take the plunge and started our first company - <mark>Oinam Software</mark>. We undertook some of the most innovative, sometimes very experimental work for clients, such as
[STARZ](http://www.starz.com/),
[Disney](http://disney.com/),
[Obeo](http://obeo.com/),
[Ultrashock](http://www.ultrashock.com/),
[Edition Interactive](http://www.editioninteractive.co.uk/),
[Cambridge University Entrepreneurs](http://www.cue.org.uk/),
[Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com).

We also worked for many Contractors who sub-contracted their work to us. We were, in fact, one of the best ghost developers to many successful Contractors.

In 2006, our team was acquired to become part of the founding team of [Mixercast, Inc](https://www.linkedin.com/company/167518). It was an exciting experience, being part of a Startup, and learning from it. Unfortunately, [Mixercast](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/mixercast) was declared dead on December 31, 2009.

In 2007, after spending a year with Mixercast, I started [oCricket](https://ocricket.com/). After 2 years of operation, oCricket was acquired by [InfinitelyBeta](https://infinitelybeta.com/) in June 2009. I was involved with the team in the making of the flagship product of Infinitely Beta - Paisa.com.

I continue to leveraging technology in finding solutions to challenges and problems. For details of my professional timeline, view my [Curriculum Vitae](https://cv.brajeshwar.com).
