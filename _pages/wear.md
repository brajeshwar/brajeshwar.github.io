# Own

> A thinking-out-loud, work-in-progress thing.
	
My life’s item should be in a single printable A4 size Paper at a readable font-size and perhaps even blocks of boxes to not try to cramp in too much item. Create a layered modular capsule wardrobe, and stay within a monochrome color, without or as minimal/discrete branding, display of logos, and no-frills.

Stay darker; the highest color would be like dark navy blue and cream on the lightest end of the palette.

A capsule wardrobe is a minimalist collection of clothes that can be put together in different ways to cover a variety of outfits and occasions. The aim is to have an outfit suitable for any occasion without owning excessive items of clothing. This is usually achieved by buying what are considered to be “key” or “staple” items in coordinating colours.

Do for other items such as electronics that are part of my life. Plan an renewal or replacement timeline. Make this part of the yearly review to plan the disposal, renewal, replacement, etc.
