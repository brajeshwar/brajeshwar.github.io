- **Turnkey end-to-end solutions, services, and products for the European Union.** Incorporate, host, employ locals, and keep everything in Europe. To scale and support, leverage the more economical workforce from Asia, working remotely via secure encrypted connections building for the Europeans. Understand the European culture, [EU-Inc](https://www.eu-inc.org), and [28th Regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28th_regime), _et al_. (Edits: Jan 29, 2026)
- [Mycelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycelium) is nature’s underground network: a living, self-growing material that binds, heals, decomposes, and communicates. Something big with focus on low-energy, biodegradable alternative to plastics, leather, insulation, packaging, and even concrete. We spent 150 years optimizing materials that don’t rot. Turns out that was a bad idea. Mycelium flips the script: materials that serve their purpose and then disappear.
- **India’s Rent Management.** Escrow for Rent deposits, for India, something like UK’s [MyDeposits.co.uk](https://www.mydeposits.co.uk). The perpetual antagonism between home renters and owners is a never-ending drama in India. A platform that is in the middle and takes care of this. Backed and under-written by Banks, NBFC, and the related papertrails, fulfilments, disagreements taken care of.
- **A pager-like emergency button.** The size of an Apple AirTag. Can send SOS on button press. Battery standard one like AirTag. Has GPS via eSIM. Microphone and Speaker once SOS mode pressed. Tie to a phone and send warning like AirTag. Security; should not be usable for tracking others. How?
- **BeeKeepers.** A non-profit international organization that educates, and exposes scammers around the world. Glorify, reward, and celebrate people who expose them. They can become public or stay anonymous. Encourage them to stay anonymous - reward them better.
- [Muon Tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon_tomography) — detection and use of cosmic ray, muons, to generate two or three-dimensional images of volumes using information contained in the Coulomb scattering of the muons. Can we use this to help find underground water? Water is becoming a global scarcity phenomenon.
- A premium sustainable re-use of branded clothes. [ThredUp](https://www.thredup.com), Poshmark, etc.
- High Premium Luxury Food. Status symbol, Exclusivity. A complete healthy lifestyle. [Erewhon](https://erewhon.com/).
- **Home Box Sync to Internet.** Like an Apple Hardware at Home. A simple computer with internal storage that backs up and syncs everything at home, with an online backup to the Internet. This should become as synonymous as a Fridge or a Washing Machine. Photos, Documents, Time Machine, Security. Target non-tech. Phone backups wirelessly and seamlessly. Seamless contact sharing, photo sharing, and file sharing.  Open Source Software that runs on any Hardware. Sell Hardware and Services.
- **Avatar - 100x. Man-in-the-Chair.** A central HUD, Command Center, the man-in-the-chair incarnation that leverages AI to do almost all of the work, just like how you would do. I think [Micro](https://www.micro.so) is trying to do this.
- **Cloudflare Alternative/Backup/Competitor.** Build a [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) alternative.
