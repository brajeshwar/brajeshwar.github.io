# OK

> You’re absolutely right.

Whatever you say, your idea, your points, you are absolutely right.
I have my own opinions, but they are mine.

Your choice of Operating System is definitely better, be it Linux, Windows, or Mac. So, are your Emacs or Vim.

I may not want to participate, but I will continue to respect your religious, political, and sporting ideologies, views, and approaches. I’m not concerned with caste, creed, color, or which household you were born to. I will respect you for what you are and what you have made of yourself.

Gone without food on many nights.
Went to school without food.
No slippers.
Realize that cold nights can be made warm with warm clothings only in 10th grade. Always assume the winters will be like that - cold shivering nights to get over with.
Migrated from my home-town for better prospects to Bombay, by borrowing ₹10,000 from my aunt, who had always helped our family with food, books, and many others.

Stole food (potatoes, pumpkins, chillies, etc.) from the neighboring vegetable garden. They knew but didn't tell us. When they gave us the harvested vegetables regularly, I began to realize that they knew all along.

Started at a no-window single-room next to a cow-shed in Bombay.

Slept on a mosquito infested bench at a Bus-stop to save money before returning from appearing in an exam in Guwahati, back to Imphal.

Been teaching younger kids since 6th grade to earn my own school fees and pocket money. Relatives helped.
