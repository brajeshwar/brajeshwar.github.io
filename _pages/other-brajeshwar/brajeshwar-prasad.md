# Brajeshwar Prasad

[Brajeshwar Prasad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brajeshwar_Prasad) (Oct 22, 1911 - Dec 7, 1979) was an Indian politician. He was elected to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India, from Gaya, Bihar, as a member of the Indian National Congress. He started his political journey as the founder of the Gaya Youth League, and he was appointed as its vice president. Prasad later became the Municipal commissioner for Gaya and served as the President of the Town Congress Committee in 1945.

He was an eminent freedom fighter and he enthusiastically participated in Indian National Congress’s national movements. He was involved in the Quit India Movement in 1942 and other national movements till 1944. He was also imprisoned for taking part in such movements. 

He was elected as a Constituent Assembly member from Gaya (Bihar) on a Congress party ticket. He contributed to discussions on citizenship, the preamble, Centre-State relations, and public health.

Rejecting the use of Mahatma Gandhi’s name in the Constitution of India, he stated, “..it is not a Gandhian Constitution. The foundation stones of this Constitution are the decisions of the American Supreme Court. It is the Government of India Act, 1935, repeated again… I do not want that the name of Mahatma Gandhi should be dragged in the rotten Constitution.” 

He was elected to the Provisional Parliament (1950-52). Later, he was elected to the first Lok Sabha (1952-57) and for a second term (1957-62). Prasad also had a special interest in foreign affairs and was a staunch proponent of the world state.
