      “A transformation project based on the latest technologies does not benefit much from a big team of engineers. It needs a tiny team of super-smart folks led by Brajeshwar.”
      <br>— <em>Mahesh Tiyyagura, ex-CTO (Aditya Birla)</em>

    My background spans engineering, design, and product leadership. Today, my work is focused on GTM and distribution. I help companies turn product maturity into revenue momentum.
  </p>

  <p>
    I step in when:
    <ul>
      <li>the product is built,</li>
      <li>the team is in place,</li>
      <li>and growth is the constraint.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>I design and run GTM systems across paid, earned, and owned channels.</strong> I work with existing teams and bring in small groups of senior operators when execution needs to move faster.
  </p>

  <p>
    What you’ll get
    <ul>
      <li>A clear GTM and distribution strategy tied to your ICP.</li>
      <li>Prioritized paid, earned, and owned channels, with ownership defined.</li>
      <li>An execution plan your team can run without hand-holding.</li>
      <li>Clear guidance on what to double down on and what to stop.</li>
    </ul>

  </p>

  <p>

    Aditya Birla Group,
    Adobe,
    University of Cambridge,

    Brajeshwar has proved to be a great asset every time our company worked with him. He has turned around complex assignments in short times, without much micro-management from our part. He has the technical and management skills of a good partner.

    Brajeshwar is a highly talented developer and new media expert with whom I had the pleasure to work with on several projects. He was always very thorough, wrote some kick-ass code and very responsive to my emails. Not only that but he's also a genuine nice guy, very helpful and always happy to share his efforts with others.
