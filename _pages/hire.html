  <h1>Hire Brajeshwar</h1>

  <h2>
    I design and run GTM systems for products that are ready to scale.
  </h2>

  <p>
    My background spans engineering, design, and product leadership. Today, my work is focused on GTM and distribution. I help companies turn product maturity into revenue momentum.
  </p>
  <p>
    I step in when:
    <ul>
      <li>the product is built,</li>
      <li>the team is in place,</li>
      <li>and growth is the constraint.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    I design and run GTM systems across paid, earned, and owned channels. I work with existing teams and bring in small groups of senior operators when execution needs to move faster.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve led teams remotely and in person, and shipped products for
    Aditya Birla Group,
    Adobe,
    University of Cambridge,
    Disney,
    DMart,
    Free2Move,
    J.P. Morgan,
    Johnson & Johnson,
    MyDeposits,
    Pearson,

    A transformation project based on the latest technologies does not benefit much from a big team of engineers. It needs a tiny team of super-smart folks led by Brajeshwar.

    Our interaction and experience have been nothing but extraordinary. Brajeshwar and his team were proactive, nimble and highly capable, which helped us move really fast from ideation to getting the product in our hand within weeks.

    Brajeshwar has proved to be a great asset every time our company worked with him. He has turned around complex assignments in short times, without much micro-management from our part. He has the technical and management skills of a good partner.

He was always very thorough, wrote some kick-ass code and very responsive to my emails. Not only that but he's also a genuine nice guy, very helpful and always happy to share his efforts with others.
