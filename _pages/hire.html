    “A transformation project based on the latest technologies does not benefit much from a big team of engineers. It needs a tiny team of super-smart folks led by Brajeshwar.”
    <br>— <em>Mahesh Tiyyagura, ex-CTO (Aditya Birla)</em>

    Most product people stop at launch. I start there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve built products at Adobe, Disney, and J.P. Morgan. Led engineering and design teams. Shipped products that mattered. Now I focus on the part most teams get wrong: making products sell after they ship.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>You’ve built something good. It needs to sell itself.</strong> The product works. The team is solid. Growth is the constraint.
  </p>
  <p>
    I design GTM systems where paid de-risks messaging, earned builds authority, and owned compounds over time. These channels work together, feeding each other momentum.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Your team stays small. The output grows.</strong> I help teams punch above their weight by building systems that scale effort without adding headcount.
  </p>

  <h3>What you get</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>GTM strategy tied to where your customers actually live.</strong> Clear targeting. Clear messaging. Clear channels.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Channel priorities with ownership defined.</strong> Paid, earned, and owned—sequenced based on your market and stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Execution systems that free your team for strategic work.</strong> Repetitive tasks run themselves. Your people focus on what needs judgment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A stop-doing list.</strong> We kill the tactics draining budget without moving metrics.
  </p>

  <h3>How I work</h3>
  <p>
    I’ve designed products, built teams, and shipped what matters. That foundation shapes how I approach GTM.
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand the product deeply because I’ve built them. I design systems that work because I know how teams actually operate. I focus on distribution because I’ve seen too many good products die from lack of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I bring structure to GTM chaos. You get clear systems where each channel has purpose and the pieces connect.
  </p>
  <p>
    Teams I work with operate like they’re twice the size. A three-person team produces like ten people. Better workflows, smarter tools, tighter feedback loops.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work with your existing team and bring in senior operators when execution needs to move faster. You learn the system. You own it. You run it.

    Brajeshwar has proved to be a great asset every time our company worked with him. He has turned around complex assignments in short times, without much micro-management from our part. He has the technical and management skills of a good partner.

    Brajeshwar is a highly talented developer and new media expert with whom I had the pleasure to work with on several projects. He was always very thorough, wrote some kick-ass code and very responsive to my emails. Not only that but he's also a genuine nice guy, very helpful and always happy to share his efforts with others.

    <strong>Pricing starts at $3,000 per week.</strong>
    I price on momentum. Did we compress time-to-revenue? Did we find a repeatable motion? Longer engagements get more efficient pricing.
