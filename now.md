<section class="now-now" markdown="1">

I started [Valinor Earth](https://valinor.earth) some time back. I've been working on my efforts to help curb climate change. After a few trials, pivots, and feedback, we decided to leverage satellite data to help companies with their efforts on climate projects with project financing, monitoring, reporting, and verification.

I work remotely out of Bangalore, India.
